![Team Maison Victoire](/src/media/team.webp)

Founded in 2007, Maison Victoire is the leading independent international estate agency in the Vaucluse.
A dynamic, responsive and bilingual team of real estate professionals, we really know our stuff, with a combined experience of over fifty years in the estate agency business.

We bridge the French/international gap by offering global advertising, social media, well-targeted software and modern marketing tools such as:

- floor plans
- virtual tours
- professional photography.

**Maison Victoire is unique in offering these services to all properties coming to market.**

So if you would like to buy or sell a stone village house, a Provençal mas, a riverside apartment or even a château, we can definitely help you. We have an excellent sales record across all price ranges, with a high ratio of sales to viewings, and this is due to our ability to listen carefully to our clients’ needs and then effectively match properties to suit their specifications.

Our clients are generous in their praise of the services we provide, saying that we are professional, efficient, organised and, above all, dedicated and helpful.
