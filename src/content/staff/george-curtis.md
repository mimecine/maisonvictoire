As the agency manager, George guarantees good levels of communication between the office management team, the estate agents, and our clients, with a calm and professional demeanour. He is in charge of new listings and is a qualified valuer. With Alexandra’s help, he ensures that every property is beautifully - and accurately - presented, and that we have a comprehensive dossier of current information for each one.

Bilingual French and English, George was born in the UK but grew up in the Luberon in the nearby village of Fontaine-de-Vaucluse. George returned to the UK to pursue a Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Birmingham in 2017 before returning to the Vaucluse to assume his role within the Maison Victoire team.

With a healthy love of the outdoors, he, and his Golden Retriever Maple, take full advantage of the many cycling, hiking, and other outdoor activities that the region provides. He also takes great interest in the rich culture of art, music, food and wine in abundance here in the Vaucluse.
