As the Agency Secretary, Meggie manages office administration and client reception with exceptional attention to detail. She plays a pivotal role in supporting George in property onboarding, ensuring that every property brought to market is accurately documented and impeccably presented. Her responsibilities also include coordinating diagnostics and surveys, liaising with photographers, and organizing weekly team meetings to ensure seamless operations.

Originally from Chipping Norton in the picturesque Cotswolds, England, Meggie relocated to Provence in 2000 with her family, fulfilling their dream of settling in the renowned village of Gordes. Having been educated in France, she is perfectly bilingual in French and English. Meggie pursued further studies in Marketing and Property Management, building a wealth of experience in the property and business sectors within the Luberon. It was in Provence that she met her French husband, a local vigneron, with whom she shares three children.

In her spare time, Meggie enjoys staying active through fitness, dining out, reading, and long walks with her beloved boxer, Russell (dog, not fighter). She also has a deep passion for the Greek islands, where she loves to escape with her family whenever the opportunity arises.
