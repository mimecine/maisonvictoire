Victoria, who holds a BA (Hons) in Estate Management (the degree of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors) is the founder and owner of Maison Victoire. A rare achievement for a British citizen, she also holds the Carte Professionnelle for the business, which is a French real estate license. Victoria obtained French citizenship in April 2022.

Victoria arrived in L’Isle-sur-la-Sorgue in 2006, thanks to her antique dealer father’s discovery of the famous market town which is renowned for its fantastic range of antique shops and markets. She soon set to work building Maison Victoire and the agency has experienced year-on-year growth ever since. The team too has expanded with the hugely successful evolution of the business, and she now has a great team behind her. This support allows Victoria to concentrate on the negotiation of sales at the luxury end of the market, as well as undertaking valuations and the strategic development of the business.

From Perthshire in Scotland, Victoria previously managed the luxury ski company, Le Chardon Mountain Lodges in Val d’Isère, and prior to that, she ran the Scottish Antique and Arts Centre in Doune, Perthshire. With a keen eye for property and interiors, her negotiating skills and a passion for Provence, Victoria and her associates provide expert representation for both buyers and sellers.

And when she’s not helping her clients to buy and sell properties, Victoria loves walking her two dogs in the beautiful Luberon countryside. She’s a big fan of Formula One and rugby and she adores skiing too, making the most of her proximity to the Alps in the winter. Her daily yoga routine is also important to Victoria who believes that achieving focus and balance is key to success!
