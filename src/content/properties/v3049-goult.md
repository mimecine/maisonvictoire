Located just a few steps from the vibrant heart of Goult – with its shops, cafés, bars and restaurants – this gorgeous 17th-century village house (dated 1699) boasts an imposing stone façade and particularly refined and timeless décor. With sweeping views across the Luberon valley and towards the Monts de Vaucluse, beautifully landscaped gardens, and remarkable privacy despite its central location, the property offers an exceptional setting in one of the region’s most sought-after villages.

The ground floor is composed of: entrance hall; elegant sitting room centred on a handsome stone fireplace; spacious and bright kitchen featuring bespoke Fabre cabinetry and an adjoining dining area. The living spaces open onto a charming terrace overlooking the garden and its stone fountain – ideal for outdoor dining and entertaining. The kitchen also opens out to an east-facing terrace, adorned with sculpted boxwood and white rose bushes, with steps descending to the swimming pool. An additional raised terrace, accessed directly from the kitchen, commands far-reaching views of the valley below.

The upper floors comprise: beautiful principal suite with spacious double bedroom, walk-in wardrobe, and bathroom fitted with a freestanding bath and walk-in shower (with Fabre cabinets); second suite (currently used as a sitting room) with adjoining office space and private shower room; third suite with cosy TV lounge and adjoining shower room.

The lower level offers: vaulted utility room (with access to the parking area); food cellar; charming vaulted wine cellar and tasting room.

The gardens extend over 840m² (0.2 acres) and are divided into distinct, beautifully landscaped spaces. A lush, lawned garden to the north is adorned with an ornate stone fountain and bordered by traditional dry-stone walls. This space benefits from lovely views of the village château and is complemented by a shaded dining terrace beneath a vine-draped pergola. Stone steps lead to a raised terrace offering an utterly staggering panorama of the Luberon valley, shaded by a tall hackberry tree. The swimming pool – a striking bassin-style pool built seamlessly into the rock – enjoys a tranquil setting and blends wonderfully with the landscape.

Amenities include: air-conditioning throughout; double glazing; mains water and drainage; fibre-optic internet; automatic watering system. The property enjoys private parking fitted with a carport.

This property exudes innate charm and character, with natural materials, generous volumes, and fantastic views throughout. A wonderfully private and elegant Luberon retreat, nestled in one of the most prized villages that the valley has to offer.
