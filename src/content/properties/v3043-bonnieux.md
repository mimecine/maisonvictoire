Located on a peaceful cobbled street above the centre of the sought-after Luberon village of Bonnieux (home to boutiques, art galleries, bars, restaurants and a bustling weekly market), this thirteenth century property has been respectfully restored by its present owners to honour its long history. Safekeeping its simplicity, the renovations have been devoted to the preservation of many of the remarkable original features that make it so exceptional. The back of the house is built directly into the rock with a vaulted stone ‘troglodyte’. The exposed stone, centuries-old beams, and hardwood floors with lovely patina, tell a story of steady craftsmanship, using local and natural materials, that has stood the test of time. This is a place of comfort and peace.

The ground floor accommodates: entrance hall with deep cupboards for storage (antique wooden doors); kitchen with Lacanche range and porcelain sink; steps leading down to sun-filled living/dining room with a charming wood-burning stove gracing the stone chimney; double bedroom with ensuite shower room and WC. Adjacent to the hallway: workshop with sink, and cellar built into the stone.

On the first floor via a wooden staircase leading up from the entry way: 18m2 bedroom with fitted closets and antique clawfoot bathtub, and breathtaking views of the Cedar Forest from the window; second bedroom with a tryptic of windows overlooking the valley; family shower room with WC. Doors to the upstairs rooms are partially glazed, allowing the sunlight to stream through. The flooring on this level is all wood.

Renovated over four years, the house offers a soothing palette of earth colours to enhance the sense of space and calm. Attention to detail, down to the vintage style light switch plates and taps, and antique doors, ensures complete harmony in the décor. Original features such as the exposed stone walls, Provençal ceilings, preserved tiled or flagstone floors, provide character and charm.

French windows open out into the walled garden. The terrace, all in stone, surrounded by trees, shrubs, and potted plants, provides shaded areas to enjoy a meal al fresco looking across the valley over the rooftops, or relax and unwind. Protected by a tall stone wall, this space ensures complete privacy and intimacy.

Amenities include: electric radiators; double glazing; bespoke wooden and wrought-iron window frames and doors, using traditional methods; fibre optic internet; mains water; mains drainage. The house has been thoroughly renovated with part of the roof recently replaced and insulated, and newly installed plumbing and electricity. Free public parking close-by.

The renovation reflects a deep respect for the house’s history and soul, as if time stood still. Turnkey ready, it offers a seamless blend of modern comforts with old world authenticity in an historic Luberon village. Just an hour from Avignon TGV and Marseille airport, this is a perfect pied-à-terre for exploring the Luberon or relaxing in the sanctuary of the peaceful interior, or outdoors on the shaded patio. It would make an exceptional year-round home, being in the heart of a bustling village with proximity to four Michelin starred restaurants.
