Nestled on a hillside just below the medieval village of Saignon - one of the Luberon's most beautiful perched villages - this superbly restored stone house offers an ideal balance of tranquility and accessibility. The setting is exceptional: the property enjoys sweeping views across the Luberon countryside, with the charm of village life just moments away. Saignon's café, bakery and restaurants are within easy reach, while the market town of Apt, with its renowned Saturday market and many amenities, is just 10 minutes by car. This is authentic Provence, where peaceful rural living meets the convenience of nearby amenities. The house sits at the heart of over two acres of beautifully landscaped grounds, commanding stunning panoramic views of rolling hills and the quintessential Provençal countryside.

The property has been thoughtfully restored, successfully balancing original character with contemporary comfort. Traditional elements - terracotta floors, exposed stone walls, and wood-burning fireplaces - have been carefully preserved, while modern amenities and tasteful decor throughout create a home of genuine quality and charm.

The main house comprises: light-filled open-plan sitting and dining room, laid with traditional terracotta tiles and arranged around a central wood-burning stove. The adjoining fully equipped kitchen features sleek cabinetry, a peninsula counter, and high-quality appliances. Both spaces open onto a vine-covered terrace framing sweeping countryside views. A few steps lead down to a stylish bathroom, a separate WC, and a spacious double bedroom with extensive built-in wardrobes. From the bedroom, a floating stone staircase leads up to a private rooftop terrace – ideal for a peaceful morning coffee or afternoon glass of rosé. 

The upper level of the house includes: guest suite with its own shower room and WC, providing complete independence for visitors. Below, on the garden level, an independent gîte offers an additional bedroom, kitchenette, shower room and storage – perfect for hosting family or generating rental income.

An elegant cypress-lined driveway leads up to the property, providing an impressive sense of arrival. The gardens extend across more than two acres of gently terraced grounds, with mature lawns, established lavender plants, and beautiful trees including oak, walnut and cedar. A productive olive grove adds authentic Provençal character and yields a modest annual harvest. The heated swimming pool enjoys an elevated position with exceptional sun exposure throughout the day and panoramic views to the south and northwest. A traditional sauna is positioned behind the house, while multiple terrace areas - including the vine-covered terrace and private rooftop space - offer varied outdoor living options to suit different times of day.

Amenities include: reversible air-conditioning throughout; wrought-iron double glazing with security glass; mains water; Canal de Provence for the garden; 2,500L rainwater collection tank; fibre-optic internet; electric gates and fencing; alarm system with cameras; garden sheds. The roof has recently been replaced.

This charming property represents a rare opportunity to acquire a tastefully renovated Provençal home in a truly outstanding location, combining complete privacy with village proximity and authentic character with modern comfort - whether as a primary residence, holiday retreat, or rental investment.
