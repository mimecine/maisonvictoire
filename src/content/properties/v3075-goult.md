Commanding a dominant position on the edge of the lively Luberon village of Goult, this remarkable stone property boasts panoramic views across the valley, utterly unobstructed from east to west. The property is composed of a handsome stone farmhouse, independent suites for guests, and a state-of-the-art gym and spa complex. Offering a terrific sense of privacy and outstanding amenities, it stands as a luxurious retreat in the heart of the Luberon valley. Elegant Provençal architecture, natural materials and the highest grade of modern comforts combine here to create a spectacular property.

An imposing hardwood door opens to reveal the foyer, where you are immediately greeted with a breathtaking view of the Luberon mountains. A stone staircase winds elegantly to the first floor. The entrance flows into a magnificent 72m² open-plan living space, lined with wrought-iron French doors that flood the interior with natural light and open seamlessly onto the main dining terrace. This expansive living area is anchored by a fireplace with sitting room on one side, and a sleek kitchen with quartz countertops on the other. The floors are beautifully clad in local Oppède stone.

The ground floor further comprises: generous office with superb views - an excellent setting for remote working; guest WC; spacious utility room; two smaller bedrooms (ideal for staff or nanny) sharing a shower room; and access to the double garage.

The first floor is composed of: master suite with dressing room and adjoining shower room with WC; second double bedroom suite with private shower room, WC and rooftop terrace – enjoying an extraordinary panorama of the Luberon valley; two further beautifully proportioned double bedrooms and two bathrooms with WC. Rich oak floors bring warmth throughout, while cathedral ceilings and sweeping views add grandeur to the suites.

The pièce de résistance is an exceptional detached stone building offering an 80m² open-plan space, fronted by oversized arched French windows that frame uninterrupted views of the landscape. This incredible space features oak flooring, soaring ceilings, and exposed beams and tiles. Currently serving as a private gym and leisure complex, it includes a bespoke bar and TV area. Adjoining this space is a superb spa, complete with sunken Jacuzzi, picture windows overlooking the southern and western views, a marble-tiled hammam, shower room, utility area and WC. A spiral staircase leads to a mezzanine bedroom, and the ground floor also houses a garage with an electric door. The entire building is fully air-conditioned and centrally heated.

Two further independent bedroom suites complete the property, each offering guests the privacy of their own shower room, together with easy access to the swimming pool.

The main house opens entirely to the south, with wrought-iron French doors leading out to the vast stone dining terrace. Panoramas stretch endlessly in every direction. Part of the terrace is covered and equipped with a summer kitchen, creating an ideal space for outdoor entertaining. From here, the lawn extends towards the grandly proportioned 17m x 7m heated swimming pool, fitted with an electric cover. A large surrounding terrace provides the perfect setting for soaking up the Provençal sun.

Amenities include: full air-conditioning; underfloor heating and cooling on the ground floor of the main house; double glazing with security glass; mains water; septic tank conforming to current regulations; fibre-optic internet; sophisticated alarm system; water softener. The property is entirely enclosed with electric fencing and accessed via two electric gates. There are two garages – a double garage for the main house and a separate garage for the gym annex.

This is an exquisite stone property, just a short distance from one of the Luberon’s most sought-after villages, with its bustling market, excellent restaurants, charming shops and bakery. Luxury, character, and contemporary comfort are brought together in an outstanding setting.
