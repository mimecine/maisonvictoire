In the very heart of Ménerbes, one of the Luberon’s most desirable villages, this stylish 18th-century stone house enjoys a privileged position just a few steps from the local restaurants, cafés, and shops. Brimming with character and authenticity, and expertly remodelled, the property offers generous volumes, chic décor, and a rare 120 m² rooftop garden commanding outstanding 280-degree views over the village, the Citadelle, Mont Ventoux, and the rolling Luberon valley. Both the house and the private garden face south, basking in Provençal sunshine all year round. 

The ground floor comprises: entrance through a charming central courtyard lined with oversized wrought-iron orangery windows; sitting room laid with cobblestone flooring; spacious office (currently serving as a bedroom); gorgeously unique guest suite featuring vaulted ceilings, stone accent walls, and an adjoining shower room; wine cellar; floating Oppède-stone staircase leading up to the first floor.

The first floor accommodates: mezzanine area flooded with natural light; elegant principal suite with an adjoining bathroom and walk-in shower.

The second floor is composed of: beautiful bespoke ‘Fabre’ kitchen opening into the sitting room; sitting room boasting high ceilings, an ornamental 'pigeonnier', traditional parfeuille tiles, a stone fireplace, and ample space for dining. Terrific views of the Luberon mountains can be enjoyed from the upper floors.

The expansive rooftop terrace and garden form an exceptional outdoor living space, perfectly private and large enough for outdoor dining and entertaining, with unrivalled sunrise-to-sunset views over the village rooftops and surrounding countryside. Perched high above the village below, the garden enjoys a private section of oak woodland - an enchanting setting!

Meticulous restoration has combined high-quality materials with master craftsmanship, preserving the property’s authentic character while delivering a particularly high level of modern comfort.

Amenities include: central heating; mains water plus private well; security system; fibre-optic internet; modern wood-framed double glazing.

With its awe-inspiring rooftop garden, refined interiors, superb views, and doorstep access to the vibrant village of Ménerbes, this property offers a unique village retreat in the Golden Triangle of the Luberon valley.
