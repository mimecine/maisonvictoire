Commanding an exceptional position overlooking the Luberon valley, this remarkable hamlet property enjoys a breathtaking natural setting, with panoramic views stretching from the eastern tip of the Luberon to the Cévennes in the west. Widely regarded as one of the most prestigious locations the region has to offer, the property combines an unrivalled sense of seclusion with timeless character and modern comfort. The estate spans over 650m2, comprising a spacious main farmhouse, an independent stone guest house, and a separate atelier/gîte outbuilding – all set at the heart of more than 6.9 acres of expertly landscaped private grounds. Entirely renovated and reimagined in 2007 with meticulous attention to detail, the interiors marry authentic character with carefully curated natural materials and bespoke contemporary fittings. Equally suited to intimate Provençal living or large-scale entertaining, this is a superb Luberon retreat of rare stature.

The Main House

The ground floor accommodates a large family kitchen fitted with a Lacanche range, a central island, and modern wrought-iron doors opening directly onto the dining terrace, revealing far-reaching views, as well as west-facing picture windows overlooking the manicured gardens. To one side, the kitchen flows through to the dining room with lovely Provençal ceilings; to the other, a traditional 'Borie' – an impressive feature room – leads into the spacious sitting room, arranged around a central suspended fireplace and framed by picture windows.

A staircase leads up to the principal suite, composed of: double bedroom with private terrace draped in vines and offering views as far as the eye can see ; dressing room with fitted cupboards; bathroom with bathtub and walk-in shower; adjoining office (or additional double bedroom). Two further double bedrooms, sharing a shower room, enjoy independent access and a private west-facing terrace – ideal for guests seeking extra privacy.

The ground floor further comprises: library; cozy 'petit salon'; bright office; utility room, guest WC; impressive, temperature-controlled, wine cellar; two guest WC. The ground floor of the main house also provides access to the adjoining 'Mazet', which provides a ground-floor double bedroom with en-suite shower room and, above, a south-facing suite with private terrace granting a direct view of the Luberon mountains.

Guest Accommodation & Annexes

The guest house offers complete independence, comprising: fully equipped kitchen; sitting room with fireplace; adjoining dining room; utility room. Two air-conditioned double bedrooms sharing a bathroom are located on the first floor.

A second guest house, the 'atelier' serves as an inspiring creative space, with a large open-plan artist's workshop bathed in natural light, separate living space with a kitchenette, and a shower room and WC. A rooftop terrace crowns the building, delivering an impressive vantage point with panoramic views reaching as far as the Cévennes and Montpellier's Pic Saint-Loup – quite possibly one of the most remarkable views the Luberon valley has to offer.

Grounds & Gardens

A wooded path leads through the grounds to the house, creating a terrific sense of arrival, with the Luberon panorama as a constant backdrop. The terraced grounds spill away from the house in thoughtfully composed layers, with uninterrupted views at every turn. Vast lawns shaded by mature truffle oaks are interwoven with traditional stone-paved terraces, intimate seating spots, and generously scaled dining areas – perfectly in proportion with the property’s accommodation.

Planting is distinctly Provençal and meticulously executed - colourful hydrangeas, sculpted shrubs, agapanthus, and oleanders line the dry-stone walls and meandering pathways. Set below the house, the swimming pool is located just a few steps away from a large covered terrace with a barbecue area – an ideal setting for long, languid lunches and evening gatherings. Approximately 150 olive trees are dotted across the grounds.

Amenities

Amenities include: underfloor heating and cooling throughout the main house; air-conditioning in the guest house and the atelier; wood and modern wrought-iron double glazing; mains water; Canal de Provence for the garden; fibre-optic internet; electric gates; automatic watering system; garden fencing; extensive outdoor lighting.

This is a property of exceptional calibre – a rare example of Provençal authenticity, architectural charm, and modern comfort – commanding one of the finest views in the Luberon.
