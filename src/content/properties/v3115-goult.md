Confidential listing – please contact us to obtain the Virtual Viewing, full set of photos and the property video.

Set in one of the Luberon’s most sought-after positions, this superb stone property enjoys an extraordinary natural backdrop, with sweeping views that extend across the valley and toward the distant mountain ranges. The property has been the subject of a masterful renovation, resulting in a harmonious blend of authentic Provençal architecture and understated contemporary elegance.

Set at the heart of more than 6.9 acres of landscaped grounds, the estate encompasses a spacious main farmhouse, an independent stone guest house, and a separate atelier/gîte outbuilding – offering superb flexibility for hosting family and friends. The interiors have been thoughtfully reimagined using natural materials, bespoke fittings, and curated design elements, resulting in an inviting retreat equally suited to relaxed daily living and entertaining on a grand scale.

The terraced gardens unfold around the buildings in a series of beautifully composed outdoor spaces, with vast lawns, dry-stone walls, shaded seating areas, and expansive dining terraces all oriented toward the sweeping Luberon panorama. A swimming pool, set just below the house and accompanied by a large covered terrace and barbecue area, provides an idyllic vantage point. The grounds further include mature truffle oaks, vibrant Provençal planting, and approximately 150 olive trees.

This is an estate of rare calibre – an exquisitely restored Provençal property offering remarkable privacy, architectural charm, and truly outstanding views, all in one of the most sought-after settings in the Luberon.
