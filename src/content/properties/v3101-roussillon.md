Close to Roussillon, one of Luberon's most sought-after villages, this spacious property enjoys magnificent unspoiled views of the surrounding countryside in a completely private location. It was designed for ultimate comfort and convenience with a nod to modern features, such as the smartphone-linked security system and solar panels, and traditional finishes, such as the terracotta tiled roof, stone pillars, and travertine floor tiles.

The ground floor comprises: entryway with mirrored storage closets, whose facing windows frame the stunning view outside; relaxation nook with bar and soothing water feature; open-plan sitting-room with magnificent oversized windows reaching to the double-height ceiling, allowing the light to pour in; double-sided fireplace with insert, shared with dining area; fully-equipped kitchen, complete with high-end appliances, whose generous island invites informal entertaining with family and friends; adjacent utility and laundry rooms; guest WC. This living area has multiple access points via sliding doors to the outdoor terrace.

The east wing of the ground floor accommodates: principal suite with lovely views from the French windows, ensuite dressing room, vast ensuite bathroom with corner tub, shower, WC and double vanity. It further comprises: TV and games room; two bedrooms with Jack and Jill shower room featuring double vanity and WC.

An elegant stone staircase leads to the first floor, composed of: guest bedroom opening onto wrap-around balcony; bathroom with tub; separate WC; generous-sized study filling the entire west wing on this floor, with windows on three sides. Both rooms enjoy ample storage space. The guest bedroom and study are connected via the mezzanine, and share the balcony.

The house sits on two acres of fully fenced-in land, of which the eastern side is planted with oaks and other native trees. The land is constructible - perfect for adding a guest cottage, for example. A sweeping driveway lined with cypresses leads you to the main entrance of the house, with ample parking, an outdoor car charging point, three-car garage and additional carport.

The garden is designed for relaxing and fully enjoying Provencal life with its Petanque court, 10m x 5m heated pool, shaded terrace for outdoor dining, and fully-equipped glassed-in summer kitchen with cathedral-style frame. Its adjoining terrace, graced with a jacuzzi, is protected with a bioclimatic pergola. A garden shed, wood store, basement, and wine cellar complete the picture.

There are numerous areas for soaking up the sun, either around the pool or in the pretty garden, whose impeccable lawn is planted with oleanders, palms and olive trees. Beyond the hedged perimeter, a gorgeous verdant vista unfolds towards farmland, rolling hills and Roussillon's iconic ochre cliffs.

Amenities include: underfloor heating and cooling throughout; double glazing; electric blinds; sophisticated solar panels system with batteries for storing excess electricity; mains drains and water; two thermodynamic water heaters; water softener; Canal de Provence water for garden (automatic sprinklers and drip system); alarm; security cameras; electric front gates with visiophone; electric garage door; fibre internet.

This beautifully-designed house is move-in ready, and would make a wonderful family home in the heart of the Luberon. Within easy reach by car of the larger towns of l'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue and Apt, and only an hour from Avignon TGV station and Marseille airport, it is perfectly situated for visiting the area's picturesque perched villages and attractions, making it also ideal as a second home with excellent rental potential if desired.
