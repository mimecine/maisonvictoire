Perched above the renowned village of Gordes, in the sought-after and tranquil commune of Murs, this superb rural estate is surrounded by acres of lavender fields and private woodland - with a babbling stream running along the property's boundary. Uninterrupted panoramic views, complete privacy and lovely wildlife make this property stand out. Thoughtfully renovated to deliver every modern comfort, the property offers everything one could wish for in a Provençal retreat. It would serve equally well as a high‑end seasonal rental, an idyllic Luberon second home, or an inspiring setting for artistic and meditation retreats.

The property comprises a spacious main residence - the Bastide - a detached guest house set well apart for independence, and large garages that could be converted into further accommodation if desired.

The Bastide

With a commanding position at the heart of the estate, the Bastide is surrounded by private grounds. The accommodation on the ground floor comprises: large 47 m² sitting room arranged around a fireplace, with arched French doors framing the valley view and opening onto the dining terrace; light‑filled dining room with garden access; adjoining kitchen; principal suite offering generous volumes and a private bathroom (bathtub, walk‑in shower and WC). The ground floor also includes: utility room; games room; technical room; guest WC; access to the wine cellar and basement.

The first floor accommodates four further double bedrooms, each benefiting from an adjoining shower room (walk‑in shower and WC). This level leads out to the rear of the property, with a private terrace and access to the garages.

All bedrooms are air‑conditioned, while under‑floor heating serves the entire ground floor.

The lower level offers a wine cellar and an additional storage room (previously fitted with a Jacuzzi).

The guest house - deliberately set away from the Bastide to guarantee privacy - comprises: living area with kitchen, dining space and sitting area; double bedroom; shower room; guest WC; vast adjoining space (58 m²) that could be converted to provide additional bedrooms.

The 17 acres of grounds surrounding the property are a wonderfully idyllic section of the Luberon valley, with glorious views throughout and not a single other house in sight. A gentle stream meanders along the bottom of the grounds, fed by a pond. South of the Bastide, vast terraces offer the perfect spot for outdoor dining and large‑scale entertaining. Steps take you down to the salt-water swimming pool (10 m × 5 m, with an electric cover). The land is planted with hectares of lavender, mature olives and truffle oaks.

Amenities include: air‑conditioning in all bedrooms; under‑floor heating on the Bastide’s ground floor; mains water; aluminium‑framed double glazing; fibre‑optic internet; security system; electric fence around the garden.

With outstanding views of the surrounding countryside, unrivalled seclusion and a refined level of modern comfort, this is the quintessential hideaway for those seeking an unspoilt and privileged piece of the Luberon countryside.
