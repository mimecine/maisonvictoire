Set against the dramatic backdrop of the Luberon mountains and within walking distance of Oppède, this extraordinary estate stands as one of the most prestigious properties the Luberon has to offer. Enjoying utter privacy, the property encompasses a magnificent 18th-century bastide, five independent guest houses, a professional tennis court, and a luxurious pool house - set at the heart of over 11 acres of exquisitely landscaped grounds. Renovated throughout to an exceptional standard, the estate exudes understated luxury, with natural materials, refined design, and every possible contemporary amenity. This is the epitome of Provençal elegance - a landmark residence in the heart of the Luberon Valley.

The Bastide
Dating back to 1789, the bastide has been masterfully restored, preserving its architectural grandeur while subtly introducing modern comforts. The bastide enjoys a vast courtyard garden, centred around a traditional stone fountain and shaded by a centuries-old fig tree. Covered terraces, large dining areas, and a fully equipped summer kitchen line the edges of the courtyard, creating an enchanting setting for outdoor dining and entertaining guests.

The ground floor comprises: entrance hall with cloakroom and guest WC; kitchen with Lacornue gas range, fireplace, and breakfast area; formal dining room; elegant sitting room with ornate stone fireplace; TV room; office with direct access to the garden.

The first floor presents an impressive master suite, composed of a generous double bedroom, vast dressing room, and en-suite bathroom. Two further suites are located on this floor, each with its own en-suite bathroom. A staircase leads to the upper level, comprising a mezzanine office and dedicated accommodation for a childminder or live-in help, complete with bathroom and WC.

The lower level accommodates: utility room; technical room; wine cellar; larder; and a walk-in safe.

Guest Accommodation & Annexes
Five beautifully appointed, and air-conditioned, guest houses are located on the grounds, each offering charm, comfort, and privacy. Three feature a double bedroom and stylish shower room, while a two-bedroom gîte offers a private kitchen and sitting room - ideal for extended stays. A separate caretaker's apartment includes a kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom.

The Pool House
The pool house is a luxurious retreat in its own right, with a full kitchen and sun-drenched living area lined with French doors. This space also includes a sauna, cold plunge, and a spacious bathroom with a wood-burning stove - perfect for unwinding after a swim. Two double bedrooms complete the pool house. The 12m x 6m heated swimming pool is fitted with a submerged electric cover.

Grounds & Amenities
The gardens have been meticulously landscaped, with vast lawns, a superb variety of indigenous trees, formal fountains, and wonderfully tended orchard and vegetable gardens. Meandering paths lead through the 'Jardin Bleu', planted beside the bastide, which offers a quiet elegance. A private pine woodland borders the grounds, adding to the property's superb sense of privacy. A professional tennis court with pavilion offers further recreational space, while a carport and a series of technical rooms ensure day-to-day functionality. Over 200 olive trees yield up to 450 litres of oil per year.

Amenities include: central heating; reversible air conditioning throughout; fibre-optic internet; safes in every bedroom; mains water; Canal de Provence connection; private well (forage); electric entrance gate; electric fencing; comprehensive security system.

This is a property of exceptional stature - a rare blend of Provençal authenticity, architectural grace, and modern luxury, offering a privileged lifestyle in the heart of the Luberon.
