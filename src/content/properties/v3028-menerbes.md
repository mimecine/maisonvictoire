At the epicenter of Ménerbes, this charming stone home seamlessly blends authentic character with contemporary sophistication. Situated in one of the Luberon's most vibrant villages, renowned for its dynamic community and rich cultural offerings, this rare, move-in ready residence with 80 m2 interior space total is bathed in natural light and boasts expansive views. Thoughtfully updated to meet modern needs, updated with impeccable taste the home invites you to enjoy the very best of village life: arts, gastronomy, nature, light, and a strong sense of community right at your doorstep.

The ground floor features an open-concept kitchen and living area, complemented by a guest WC. Sunlight pours through large windows, illuminating every detail of this thoughtfully designed space.
A bespoke staircase leads to the second floor, where the master bedroom and a second bedroom (currently used as an office) enjoy stunning valley views. A bathroom with a shower serves this level, and across from the master, French doors open to a small garden area, the perfect spot for a quiet coffee or reading session.

The expansive top floor is a bright and versatile with skylights, additional French doors, and a second private bathroom with a shower. A discreet closet houses a washer and eventual dryer. Currently used as a bedroom, this floor offers endless possibilities for customization.

Every detail in this home has been thoughtfully curated—terracotta tiles, wooden doors with wrought iron hardware, and large double-glazed windows create a harmonious atmosphere throughout, connecting each room with seamless elegance. This sophisticated village property offers far more than meets the eye.
