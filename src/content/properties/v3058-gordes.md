This lovely stone property is located a few minutes by car from the centre of the renowned village of Gordes, in a bucolic setting surrounded by trees and fields. The views towards the Luberon and the Alpilles are simply stunning, all to be enjoyed from the terrace, the lavender-scented garden, or the swimming pool. Close to the other iconic Luberon villages of Roussillon, Lacoste, Bonnieux and Ménerbes, this well-maintained property with its typical Provençal garden is a perfect base for exploring the area, and then relaxing over a glass of rosé contemplating the sunset after a day of sight-seeing.

The ground floor is composed of: open-plan sitting and dining area with fireplace, lined with French windows letting the sunlight stream in. The windows lead out to a spacious terrace, shaded with a retractible awning. The light and airy fully-equipped kitchen (including washing-machine) with sit-around island has practical direct access to the parking area. The ground floor also comprises: master bedroom with lovely views from the window and ensuite bathroom with double sink and WC; two spacious bedrooms looking out towards ‘la Colline St Jacques’ and the Alpilles mountain range; family bathroom; TV nook or play area; fourth bedroom.

Downstairs to the garden level: fifth bedroom with ensuite shower room; adjoining living room with large French windows leading out to the terrace.

The garden, which covers nearly two and a half acres, and slopes gently down from the property, is home to an impressive olive grove producing over 100 litres of olive oil. Oleanders and other native plants grace the impeccably maintained grounds, and a stone pathway flanked by fragrant lavender leads you to the saltwater pool, where there is ample room for family and friends to sunbathe on loungers before taking a dip. Around the house, areas are designed for al fresco relaxing and dining in the shade (or in the sun on a bright winter day) – either on the upper or lower terrace, next to the kitchen, or under the canopy of an ancient olive tree.

Amenities include: ducted reversible A/C ground floor; radiators and portable A/C unit on the garden level; all-waters septic tank meeting current regulatory standards; mains water (possibility to be hooked up to the Canal de Provence); ADSL internet; alarm; automatic watering system. Ample parking space. There is a vast crawl space at almost standing height under the house providing plentiful storage and a wine cellar. Garden shed.

This unmissable property is move-in ready. It would serve as a delightful Luberon retreat (less than an hour from Avignon TGV and Marseille airport) or as an investment property for attractive seasonal rental returns.
