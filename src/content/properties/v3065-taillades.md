Set within a beautifully preserved natural landscape on the edge of Les Taillades, this distinguished property offers an exceptional standard of comfort, total seclusion, and timeless Provençal character. The property comprises a charming stone farmhouse, two independent guest houses, independent guest suites, two swimming pools and a tennis court.

The main house, a handsome mas surrounded by mature trees and landscaped grounds, enjoys complete privacy. Designed for refined yet relaxed living, the ground floor comprises: large living area with large dressed stone fireplace, exposed stone walls and beams; large dining room with stone walls and beams; additional dining area with large arched doors leading out to the terrace; spacious kitchen with Lacanche oven range and wrought-iron glass doors granting access to the pool area; double bedroom with ensuite bathroom and sliding doors out to the pool area; double bedroom with adjoining shower room; laundry room; storage room / cellar; sports room; guest WC. 

The first floor accommodates a further four ensuite bedrooms, two of which benefit from independent access to the garden. There is also a self-contained suite, located in the garden, living area and bathroom.

The pool area is particularly impressive - offering the perfect spot to entertain guests or relax under the hot Provençal sun - with a series of stone terraces arranged across several levels, a large covered terrace with Pizza oven and summer kitchen, and an inviting gazebo overlooking the swimming pool. The swimming pool (12m x 6m) is tiled and heated.

In addition to the main house, the estate includes two further guest houses:

The first guest house, with access to its own pool (10m x 5m), has been renovated to a high standard with modern décor and appliances. The accommodation, on the ground floor, comprises: large, open-plan living dining; modern kitchen with French doors leading to the garden; two ensuite double rooms; guest WC. The first floor accommodates a further two spacious bedroom suites.

A third dwelling, perfect for use as a caretaker’s cottage or additional guest accommodation, offers an open-plan kitchen living area, two further bedrooms and a bathroom.

A tennis court completes the grounds of this impressive Luberon property.

The entire estate has been maintained to a high standard, complemented by terrific authentic character and modern comfort throughout. Amenities include: underfloor heating and cooling via heat pump on the ground floor of the main house; reversible air conditioning throughout; garage; mains and Canal de Provence water in addition to a private water source (borehole).

Rare on the market, this substantial property offers a unique chance to enjoy the tranquillity and charm of Provence - whether as a sizeable family home or a lucrative rental/B&B in the heart of the Luberon. The location is especially advantageous for hospitality: proximity to Les Taillades’ village centre, minutes from the Luberon’s famous hill top villages, and an easy drive to the lively market town of L’Isle sur la Sorgue, the airport, and the Avignon TGV station.
