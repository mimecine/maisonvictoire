This former stone farmhouse, full of charm and built in stone, is just steps from the central square of Gordes yet offers complete tranquillity in a preserved natural setting. It combines the intimacy of the countryside with all the advantages of a village house, making it a true hidden gem. Once you pass through the gate, the proximity to the village is very quickly forgotten.

The setting is idyllic, and the main house - set on one floor - features generous, bright volumes with a modern layout. Facing due south, the house has a shaded terrace under a wrought-iron pergola, overlooking a delightful terraced Provençal garden planted with olive and fig trees, lavender, and vines. The open view is superb, stretching all the way to the Alpilles. The property sits on 0.8 acres of constructible land, offering terrific potential for expansion and development.

Inside, the rooms are bathed in natural light, with a simple, open plan layout and cathedral pine ceilings. The whole property displays a rare harmony for a house of this age. The gîte with its own gated access, the independent artist studio and the additional suite with a separate entrance offer multiple possibilities: seasonal rentals, hosting friends or family, or accommodation for a live-in helper. The bedrooms, spacious and airy, each have their own bathroom or shower room, ensuring optimal comfort.

The main house, mostly on one level, is organised around a large, welcoming space with a wood stove, combining a gorgeous sitting room, dining area, kitchen, office, and library. This level also includes two bedrooms, one featuring an ensuite bathroom. The suite, consisting of a bedroom with shower and a private terrace on the lower level, is accessible from both inside and outside.

The fully independent gîte has its own entrance via a second gate to the property. This comprises: sitting room; kitchen; bedroom; shower room; WC; private dining terrace.

Amenities include: mains water and drainage; automatic watering system; exterior lighting; windows with double glazing; air conditioning in the sitting room and main bedroom; fibre-optic internet; artist studio with exposed stone walls and large bay windows; technical room with central oil heating; garden shed, wood storage.

A rare opportunity to own an authentic yet effortlessly elegant home in one of the most prized settings in the Luberon, within walking distance of all local restaurants, cafés, bars and restaurants - the very definition of Provençal refinement.
