Located in a gorgeous rural setting, with landscaped gardens and unobstructed views of Oppède-le-Vieux and the surrounding Luberon valley, this mid-century bastide-style property combines character, lovely volumes, abundant natural light, and complete privacy. Benefitting from a picturesque Mediterranean garden, a saltwater swimming pool and a self-contained gîte, this 210 m² property offers an ideal retreat in the heart of the Luberon, just a short drive from Coustellet and its shops and weekly market. The villages of Oppède and Maubec are accessible on foot.

The ground floor comprises: large entrance hall with staircase leading up to the first floor and picture windows framing the magnificent valley views; south-facing living space incorporating a sitting room and dining area, complete with fireplace and tall French doors opening onto the dining terrace; kitchen fitted with Fabre units and an adjoining larder/utility room with steps leading down to the cellar. The ground floor also accommodates a self-contained gîte, featuring a double bedroom with wood-burning stove, a kitchen and a shower room. The gîte benefits from its own separate entrance and a covered terrace.

The first floor is composed of: principal suite with an adjoining shower room, double vanity and WC; two further double bedrooms (currently used as an office and an additional sitting room); linen cupboard.

The 3.5-acre grounds have been beautifully landscaped with a great variety of indigenous plants and mature trees, creating a tranquil setting of woodland and Mediterranean plantings. An authentic cabanon ruin adds Provençal charm. A 14.5 m × 3.5 m saltwater swimming pool, fitted with a submerged cover, enjoys a lovely view of the medieval village of Oppède-le-Vieux — which is particularly beautiful when illuminated at night — as well as a far-reaching view of Mont Ventoux. Additional outbuildings include a large atelier with newly installed double-glazed doors, and a tool shed. The surrounding land is protected farmland and natural woodland, ensuring the peace and quiet of the property.

Amenities include: underfloor heating; double glazing (aluminium); fibre-optic internet; alarm system; mains water; automatic garden watering system. The roof has been entirely replaced. The property can be extended if desired.

With its stunning natural setting, mid-century architecture and excellent potential for seasonal rental income, this property offers a lovely Provençal retreat in the Golden Triangle of the Luberon valley.
