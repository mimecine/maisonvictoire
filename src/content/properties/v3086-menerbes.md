Located in a peaceful setting just minutes from the desirable village of Ménerbes, this 18th-century stone house captures the very essence of Provençal charm. Steeped in history and character, the property combines authentic architectural details with modern comforts, creating a home that feels both timeless and welcoming.

Inside, original features such as Provençal ceilings, exposed beams, and stone elements have been lovingly preserved, while thoughtful renovations with high-quality materials bring warmth and modern convenience.

The ground level comprises: welcoming kitchen with fireplace, stone sink, and grand skylight; adjoining dining area with direct access to stone wine cellar; cozy sitting room with working fireplace and original stone water trough - all set upon elegant Bourgogne stone floors. A WC, shower room with Zellige tiling, and utility/laundry room complete this level.

The first floor houses: small room that may serve as an office or child's bedroom; spacious principal bedroom with access to an adjoining room, ideal as a dressing area or office; additional bedroom; bathroom with a classic clawfoot tub, adding a touch of elegance. Beautiful oak wood floors are laid throughout the entire upper floor. 

An independent air-conditioned 26m² stone outbuilding offers further potential, ready to be transformed into a guest house, artist's studio, or cozy gîte.

Outside, a private inner stone courtyard shaded by a pergola provides a relaxing outdoor living space, with a 250-year-old staircase standing as a reminder of the property's remarkable history. A beautifully landscaped walled garden offers privacy as well as views of the surrounding cliffs and includes: heated bassin-style pool; outdoor shower; greenhouse; stone outbuilding for storing firewood or garden equipment.

Amenities include: reversible air conditioning; electric hot water heater; mains and canal water; double-glazed oak windows; fibre internet; automatic garden irrigation; sheltered parking for two cars.

This property is exceptional for its authenticity, privacy, and prime location near one of the Luberon's most celebrated villages. Combining historic charm with modern convenience, it presents a rare opportunity to own a true Provençal retreat - whether as a permanent residence, pied-à-terre, or character-filled rental investment.
