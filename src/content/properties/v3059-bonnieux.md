Beautifully renovated, this 18th-century village house enjoys a prime location in the heart of Bonnieux, nestled in the renowned Golden Triangle. Facing due south, it offers breathtaking panoramic views from the garden.

Full of charm and character, the property comprises an independent 50 m² studio with an open-plan living space that includes a kitchen and dining area, a guest WC, and a shower room — perfect for welcoming guests or generating rental income. The main house features a spacious kitchen and dining room that open onto a south-facing balcony with an authentic wrought iron railing. This level also includes a guest WC and shower room, and leads to a cosy living room with a vaulted ceiling and a stunning exposed natural stone wall.

Upstairs, there are two large double bedrooms, a third smaller bedroom, and a family shower room.

Outside, the terraced garden is a true haven of peace with a 3.5 x 3.5 metre plunge pool, sunny and shaded spots for relaxing, a solarium with spectacular views, and a remarkable wine cellar carved directly into the rock.

The renovation has been carried out using high-quality materials and finishes, including air conditioning throughout, brand new electrical and plumbing systems, polished concrete floors, fibre-optic internet connection, and double-glazed wrought iron windows in some areas. The house also boasts beautiful exposed beams, vaulted ceilings, and stone arches dating back to the 17th century, along with exposed natural stone walls that elegantly reflect the charm of a bygone era.

This exceptional property would make an ideal pied-à-terre in the world-famous hilltop village of Bonnieux, right in the heart of the Golden Triangle, with excellent rental potential if desired.
