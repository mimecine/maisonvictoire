This stunning property enjoys a privileged position, just a pleasant 10-minute stroll from the historic centre of Gordes. The construction is of the highest quality, carried out by carefully selected local artisans with meticulous attention to detail. Modern comfort is seamlessly blended with reclaimed materials, creating an idyllic setting perfectly suited to contemporary living.
A newly installed heat exchanger powers the underfloor heating and cooling system, with additional air conditioning in the bedrooms—ensuring efficient and consistent climate control throughout the property.

A spacious entrance hall leads into the impressive 100 m² open-plan area, which flows effortlessly towards the sun-drenched pool terrace, the inviting covered outdoor living space, or the tranquil olive grove. This expansive area includes a kitchen, dining area, and sitting room with traditional open-fireplace, while the library/games room is adorned with a striking high vaulted ceiling, adding an extra layer of charm. The ground floor also features a spacious ensuite bedroom, which boasts independent access to the south-facing terrace, offering both privacy and practicality with easy access to the gardens and grounds.

The first floor offers two additional suites and a well-appointed office, all featuring generous proportions and elegant décor that reflects the refined character of the property.

The timeless natural stone Dordogne floors, reclaimed wooden beams, and elegant French ceilings are just a few of the exquisite features that contribute to the exceptional atmosphere of this outstanding property.
