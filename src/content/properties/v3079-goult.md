Set amongst picturesque oak woodland and gorgeous natural scenery, this tastefully remodelled two-acre property is located in the heart of the Golden Triangle, close to the sought-after village of Goult. Spacious and cleverly re-imagined for modern living, the property is composed of a large main house and an independently accessed gite for guests. With its sun-drenched living area and oversized picture windows offering far-reaching views, this property enjoys absolute privacy, comfort and style – a fantastic Luberon retreat.

The ground floor is composed of: spacious sitting room with double-height ceilings, exposed beams and a fireplace, with sliding doors opening out onto the terrace and offering unobstructed Luberon views; large contemporary kitchen with island unit, Brazilian granite countertops, and views as far as the eye can see. This floor further comprises: office (which could serve as a bedroom); principal suite bedroom with built-in cupboards and French windows opening onto the terrace; bathroom with bathtub and rainfall shower; guest WC.

The first floor comprises: two double bedrooms, one of which is fitted with built-in cupboards; family bathroom with shower and double vanity; WC.

Set in nearly two acres of landscaped grounds, the property offers a typical Provencal dry garden, home to a wide variety of native flowering plants, shrubs, trees and herbs, and surrounded by mature woodland. Meandering paths lead through the gardens, with a series of shaded seating areas and dining terraces offering spots to relax, unwind and enjoy the peaceful surroundings. At the heart of the garden lies a 10m x 5m salt-water swimming pool, framed by a wide stone terrace with plenty of space for sun loungers.

The property also benefits from an air-conditioned workshop (ideal for creative use, or as an office for remote working), as well as a large garage.

Amenities include: heat pump central heating; air conditioning in the living space; photovoltaic solar panels; mains water; Canal de Provence water (with contract) for the garden; double glazing; electric gates with intercom; fibre optic internet; spacious garage with specialised socket for electric car charging and a carport for additional parking.

Nestled in the heart of the Luberon, this property combines the authentic charm of Provence with all the comforts of modern living. It would be perfect as a comfortable family home, a peaceful holiday retreat, or a lucrative rental investment. Ideally situated just minutes from Goult, Gordes, and the most picturesque villages of the Golden Triangle, this is a rare opportunity.
