A few kilometres from the sought-after village of Gordes, right in the heart of the Luberon, this beautifully restored stone farmhouse perfectly balances authentic Provençal charm with modern elegance. Nestled within an inviting walled garden for complete privacy, the property also boasts a swimming pool – ideal for relaxed afternoons in the sun. The property is located in a peaceful hamlet just minutes away from the picturesque village of Murs, with its emblematic 12th-century fortified castle. Perched at an altitude of nearly 500 metres, the village enjoys cooler summers and a tranquil, natural setting surrounded by oak forests and lavender fields.

The ground floor is composed of: separate sitting room; open-plan dining, living and kitchen space. This chic light-filled area has soft green walls to complement the smart white kitchen cabinetry and pale polished concrete floors, and enhance the warmth of the bricks behind the Laconche range. Adjacent, the spacious sitting room featuring a handsome stone fireplace and exposed white-washed beams, with French windows leading out to the garden. The ground floor also comprises a laundry room, storage space and cloakroom with WC.

The first floor comprises: master bedroom with ensuite shower room and fitted closets; second double bedroom suite with adjoining bathroom; third bedroom; family bathroom; WC; office. Eye-catching coloured tiles in the bathrooms combined with the muted Provençal hues of the décor add to the overall visual attractiveness.

The intimate walled garden is absolutely private – offering shaded spots for al fresco dining as well as places to soak up the sun. Surrounded by greenery from the vines climbing the walls, the grassy nooks, trees, shrubs and flowers, the pool area is lovely and easily accessed from the house.

Amenities include: A/C on the ground floor; electric radiators; mains water and drainage as well as a private well; fibre optic internet. Parking available inside the walls.

This unmissable property has been tastefully updated, and offers a delightful Luberon retreat with timeless appeal and modern convenience in equal measure. It would, furthermore, serve as an investment property for attractive seasonal rental returns.
