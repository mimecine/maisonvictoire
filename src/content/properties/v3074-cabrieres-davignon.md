Just a short walk from the charming heart of Cabrières-d’Avignon, this property offers a rare combination: a peaceful, natural setting within walking distance of village amenities — bakery, restaurant, and grocery store. A true everyday luxury. 

Set within a landscaped garden with panoramic views of the Luberon, the house enjoys its own private olive grove, a high-quality of construction, and bright, well-proportioned living spaces.

The ground floor includes: spacious living area with wood-burning stove and French doors opening to the outdoors; custom Fabre kitchen with adjoining covered terrace; master suite with built-in wardrobes and ensuite bathroom (with both shower and bathtub); large utility room; generous garage offering ample storage space.

The first floor features three charming bedrooms that share a family shower room. Each of the upstairs rooms enjoys particularly lovely views over the surrounding countryside and the Luberon hills.

Outdoors, the landscaped garden offers stunning views of the Luberon mountains, a covered dining terrace, and an 8m x 4m swimming pool with paved terraces and a second covered seating area — ideal for escaping the hot summer sun. Beyond, the mature olive grove produces over 10 litres of its very own olive oil each year.

Amenities include: underfloor heating and cooling via heat pump (ground and first floors); double glazing with wooden frames; fantastic insulation (Trilatte roof panels); mains drainage; mains water; fully enclosed plot thanks to stone walls.

A rare opportunity combining all the most sought-after features in the Luberon. Whether you're searching for a main residence, a holiday home, or a long-term investment, this house ticks all the boxes — and is sure to appeal to lovers of peace, nature, and Provençal authenticity.
