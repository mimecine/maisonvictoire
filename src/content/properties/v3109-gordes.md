Set within walking distance of the renowned village of Gordes, this exquisite stone property offers a rare combination of privacy, refined living, and Provençal authenticity. Enclosed within 0.95 acres of expertly landscaped grounds, the property comprises a luxurious main house, an independent gîte, artist's atelier, and a picturesque stone tower offering guest accommodation – each blending harmoniously into the manicured gardens planted with centuries-old olive trees, cypress, acacia, and boxwood.

The main house offers superb volumes, drenched in natural light, striking an effortless balance between traditional charm and contemporary comfort. French windows open onto the terraces and gardens, ensuring a seamless transition between indoor and outdoor living. The ground floor comprises: inviting sitting room with an oversized picture window granting unobstructed views of the Luberon mountains; formal dining area; spacious kitchen with adjoining larder and breakfast terrace; ground-floor bedroom suite (currently used as an office), ideal for guests or family members.

The first floor accommodates: lavish principal suite, with vast windows looking out over the formal gardens and Luberon Valley, and an adjoining shower room; second double bedroom suite, with private shower room. Throughout, the interiors are characterised by lovely natural materials, bespoke joinery, and superb fittings and furnishings that complement the property’s Provençal architecture. The living spaces and the principal bedroom benefit from underfloor heating/cooling; the rest of the property is fitted with reversible air conditioning.

Across the garden, a self-contained guest house offers a private living space, kitchenette, and double bedroom suite – the perfect retreat for visiting family or friends. Beyond, a charming stone tower, the property's pièce de résistance – once a romantic folly, now converted into a unique guest house – exudes authenticity. With its own orangery-style living area, bedroom, and private garden terrace with spectacular views, it provides independent accommodation in a setting of rare character and charm.

Paths lead through the ancient olive groves, adorned with sculpted boxwood and fragrant planting. At the lower edge of the property, the bassin-style swimming pool sits gracefully within its landscaped surrounds, framed by stone terraces and mature planting. The property is fenced and gated and enjoys an unrivalled sense of privacy.

Amenities include: underfloor heating and cooling in the living spaces and the principal suite; reversible air conditioning throughout the rest of the property; fibre-optic internet; mains water; automatic watering; electric gates; an alarm system. The property also benefits from a historic natural spring, which feeds the stone well during the wetter months – an evocative reminder of the property’s history.

Peaceful, authentic, and gorgeously elegant, this estate captures the timeless appeal of Provençal living – morning walks to the village bakery, leisurely lunches beneath the shade of olive trees, and evening apéritifs whilst enjoying the mesmerising views and sunsets. A rare and refined property, just a short walk from Gordes yet offering complete privacy – the perfect retreat.
