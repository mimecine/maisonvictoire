The property also benefits from an independent suite, located in the garden, ideally positioned to accommodate guests.

The pool area provides a particularly inviting setting in which to relax and enjoy the Provençal climate, thoughtfully arranged with a series of stone terraces. A large covered terrace hosts a pizza oven and summer kitchen, while a shaded gazebo overlooks the tiled and heated swimming pool measuring 12m x 6m.

Amenities include: underfloor heating and cooling via heat pump on the ground floor; reversible air conditioning throughout; garage; mains water; Canal de Provence water; private borehole.
