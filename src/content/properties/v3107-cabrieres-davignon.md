This spacious property, consisting of a main house and separate gîte, enjoys a superbly bucolic setting, away from nearby neighbours, within walking distance of the popular village of Cabrières-d’Avignon. Set in the heart of the Luberon’s prized Golden Triangle, this south-facing house opens out to a fabulous patio overlooking the wooded garden. Adjacent to the house is an atelier with running water and electricity.

The ground floor of the main house comprises: lovely light-filled sitting/dining area (56m2) with polished cement floor, exposed wooden beams and two handsome French windows with wrought-iron frames leading out to the patio. A fireplace (with insert) surrounded by wall-to-ceiling bookshelves graces the far end of the sitting room. Adjacent to the living area: office or TV room with built-in cupboards; modern fitted kitchen with stainless steel cabinetry, Zimbabwe granite countertops and high-top breakfast bar; back kitchen/laundry room with water heater and second fridge. 

The east wing offers: principal bedroom with dressing room and ensuite bathroom (bathtub, shower, and vanity all in marble surround, and WC); separate guest WC. 

The west wing consists of two further bedrooms, each with ensuite shower room. Gorgeous solid wood doors, some paned to allow extra light through, are fitted throughout the house, including the bathrooms and cupboards, and are a remarkable feature.

The gîte comprises: sitting room and Provence-themed bedroom on the ground floor; mezzanine floor with shower room (with extra washing-machine) and further bedroom.

The garden is fully secluded, enclosed by walls and fragrant eleagnus hedges. It is planted with native species including green and white oaks, oleanders, olives and lavender, and remains faithful to its Provençal nature. Behind the kitchen is a herb garden, shaded outdoor dining area, plancha and woodstack. The impressive front patio, whose Virginia creeper-covered pergola provides shade for outdoor eating and relaxation, greets you as you arrive at the front door. From here, steps and pathways lead you towards the swimming pool, secured by a recently-installed electric cover. With a stone bench here, a fountain there, grassy areas and leafy hideaways, the garden lends itself superbly to family life, with plentiful places for playing and relaxing (including a wooden playhouse).

Amenities include: ducted A/C throughout the main house; electric radiators in the gîte; double glazing with security glass; mains water; automatic watering system; electric gates with brand-new motor; ample parking on the property.

This spacious and beautifully presented home with its gîte, providing independent additional accommodation, would be ideal either as a family home, a Luberon retreat, or a profitable rental investment. It enjoys peace and quiet, yet is well-situated for visiting the valley’s renowned perched villages, and a convenient hour away by car from Avignon TGV and Marseille airport.
