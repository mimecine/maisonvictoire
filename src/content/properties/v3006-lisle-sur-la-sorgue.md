Nestled between the renowned Luberon villages and just moments from the picturesque l'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, this meticulously renovated traditional farmhouse offers a harmonious blend of charm, luxury, and investment potential. The property is centred around a serene courtyard, with three independent guesthouses, a spacious master apartment, and a wealth of exceptional amenities.

This epitome of relaxation features lush gardens, a stunning swimming pool, a private gym, a Hammam, and a spa - ensuring an unparalleled sense of tranquility. A double-vaulted 'chai' (a barn formerly used for storing wine) adds further potential, whether for conversion into an indoor pool, a tennis court, or even a sophisticated wine-tasting room. Currently operating as a successful B&B, the property presents an outstanding opportunity for conversion into a seasonal accommodation or as a family compound, offering multiple homes within a single estate.

The heart of the property is the sun-drenched courtyard, ideal for enjoying leisurely breakfasts or evening aperitifs. At the centre lies a welcoming office space, currently serving as the reception area for guests.

On the first floor, the guesthouse features three additional bedroom suites, and a fourth bedroom with a private balcony and panoramic views of the surrounding landscape.

The thoughtful design and meticulous quality of the renovations make this property incredibly versatile. The spaces can be used independently or combined into one grand family home, with each wing offering its own distinct sense of privacy. The property’s configuration lends itself perfectly to a high-end guesthouse, or multi-family living, offering excellent rental potential. An efficient storage space and laundry facilities make entertaining all the easier.
