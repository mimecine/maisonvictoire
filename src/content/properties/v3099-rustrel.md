Combining traditional features with modern convenience, this lovely 19th century village house sits in the very centre of Rustrel, a bustling village known for its iconic "Colorado Provençal" ochre cliffs. With its restaurants, boulangerie, and grocery store, Rustrel lends itself to comfortable year-round living. Nearby lies the larger town of Apt, renowned for its vibrant Saturday market and wide range of shops and services.

Full of charm and character, and showcasing many authentic features, such as the kitchen's original tiled floor and the stunning Provençal ceiling in the two sitting rooms, the property's tasteful renovation was completed in 2023, using quality materials.

The ground floor comprises: light-filled sitting/dining room with an eye-catching exposed natural stone wall and new windows overlooking the courtyard; dine-in kitchen with sleek cabinetry and new appliances; utility/laundry room; shower room with WC; cosy second sitting room with wheelchair access from the outdoor parking space; access to vaulted cellar.

The first floor is composed of: three spacious bedrooms, one of which has mezzanine storage, each one with ensuite shower-room and WC.

On the top floor: shower-room with WC; ample space well-lit by Velux windows to create two further bedrooms.

Outside, the fully-enclosed courtyard is accessible via the sitting room and kitchen, offering complete privacy for al fresco dining under the shade of a pergola, or a refreshing splash in the plunge pool. The surrounds for the windows and entryways add elegance to the house's original exposed stone façade.

Amenities include: mains drains and water; private parking space; free street parking. Included in the renovation: roof; all electrics and plumbing; polished travertine floors; reversible air conditioning throughout; double-glazed wrought iron window and door frames; fibre internet.

This gem would make an ideal pied-à-terre in a beautiful part of the Luberon, within easy reach by car of the picturesque perched villages of the Golden Triangle and excellent restaurants in nearby Saint-Saturnin-lès-Apt, Villars and Caseneuve. It also has excellent rental potential if desired.
