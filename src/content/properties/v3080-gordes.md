This handsome stone farmhouse lies in the heart of the Gordes countryside and has been the subject of a complete and masterful renovation. Nestled within 7.4 acres of private fruit orchards, olive groves, and landscaped gardens, the property offers remarkable privacy and superb views of the Luberon mountain range. The craftsmanship throughout is exemplary, combining high-quality materials, a refreshingly contemporary palette, gorgeous original features, and refined décor – all working together to create a harmonious blend of authenticity and modern comfort.

The accommodation begins with a welcoming open-plan living space, where a striking floating stone staircase and a glass-walled wine cellar set the tone. This great room comprises: bespoke contemporary kitchen by Fabre with black quartz countertops; sun-drenched sitting room benefitting from triple-aspect French windows framing views over the countryside towards the Luberon; generous dining area. The ground floor also includes a principal suite with adjoining shower room and fitted cupboards. Floors throughout are laid in beautiful Jerusalem stone.

The first floor comprises two spacious double bedrooms sharing a shower room with WC and walk-in shower. Two further independent suites on the garden level complete the accommodation, each benefitting from its own private shower room and WC, as well as direct access to the terraces and gardens.

The landscaped grounds are beautifully designed, with flowering plants and manicured shrubs ensuring both privacy and colour throughout the year. A variety of terraces encompass the farmhouse, providing different areas for entertaining family and friends. The main living spaces open directly onto a dining terrace shaded by a pergola and overlooking the gardens. A cypress-lined avenue leads to a west-facing seating area, perfectly positioned to enjoy sunsets among the olive trees. To the east, a charming courtyard shaded by two plane trees and planted with boxwood and flowering shrubs creates a picturesque Provençal setting.

Overlooking the grounds, the heated saltwater swimming pool (10m x 5m) is equipped with a submerged electric cover and a heat pump, and is complemented by a shaded seating area and a generous wrap-around terrace.

Amenities include: reversible air-conditioning throughout the house; mains water and Canal de Provence irrigation for the garden; compliant septic system; fibre-optic internet; double glazing with bespoke wood and wrought-iron frames; carport.

Perfectly located in the Gordes countryside, within easy reach of Coustellet, Ménerbes, Goult, and Cabrières-d'Avignon, this property represents an outstanding blend of Provençal charm, architectural refinement, and modern convenience. It would serve equally well as a luxurious holiday retreat or as an attractive rental investment opportunity.
