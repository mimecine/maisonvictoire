A short walking distance from the centre of Villars, much prized by locals for its excellent restaurants, this charming property delights the eye with its traditional stone facade and wooden shutters, topped with an authentic dovecote. Inside, its generous, light-filled living spaces showcase lovingly preserved features, including the vaulted ceiling and stone floor on the garden level, original solid wood doors, Provencal ceilings, exposed stone and wooden beams. The unexpectedly spacious and truly stunning principal suite on the second floor harmoniously unites these latter elements.

The garden floor comprises: fully-equipped eat-in kitchen; scullery with wine fridge; technical room. A few steps lead up to a spacious double bedroom with ensuite shower room and WC; adjoining walk-in closet.

The first floor comprises to the east, a spacious living/dining area with bar and fireplace; adjacent balcony, accessible to the outside via stone steps. A staircase at the end of the room leads to: guest bedroom with WC and vanity. The other side of this floor comprises: office with floor-length bookshelves; guest bedroom; shower room with double vanity and washing machine; separate WC.

On the second floor, the gorgeous principal suite features: impressive sitting room with cathedral ceiling and large picture window, adorned with original wooden shutters, looking out towards the neighbouring village of Saint-Saturnin-les-Apt and beyond to the Vaucluse mountains; spacious bedroom with traditional Provencal ceiling, exposed stone walls, polished wood floors and roomy closet; generous walk-in closet; bathroom with tub, shower, double vanity and WC. A cosy library nook built into the dovecote greets you at the top of the stairs.

The walled garden provides an intimate setting designed for enjoying outdoor living year-round. The generous canopy of the Mulberry tree provides shade during the hotter months for al fresco dining; around the pool there is plentiful space to soak up the sun. The garden is easy-to-maintain with a combination of gravel ground cover and stone paving, flowering shrubs and potted plants.

Amenities include: oil-fired central heating; double glazing throughout; wood-burning fireplace; water softener; mains drains and water; automatic watering system in place; outdoor lighting; fibre internet; closed garage for one car; further parking within and outside of the property.

Move-in ready, this lovely house will captivate its new owners with its authentic Provencal features, generous-sized bedrooms and living area, and magnificent principal 'dovecote' suite on the top floor. The views of the sweeping countryside, taking in lavender fields and vines, are unforgettable. Within easy reach by car of Apt, with its shops, services, and renowned Saturday market, and half an hour from the famed perched villages of the Luberon, this property would be ideal either as a family home or as a second home, with excellent rental potential if desired.
