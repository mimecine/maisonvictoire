This superb villa nestles in 1.7 acres of landscaped gardens and grounds. A cypress-lined driveway leads to the property, which combines elegant living spaces with modern comforts. 

The ground floor features a bright living area surrounded by large French windows, bathing the space in light and opening onto a terrace overlooking the Luberon mountains; a well-equipped open-plan kitchen; a master suite with bathtub and walk-in shower; and a guest wc.

The garden level comprises three generous double bedroom suites, each with an adjoining shower room; a utility room; a technical room; and additional storage. Comfort is ensured with underfloor heating on the ground floor and ducted air conditioning in all bedrooms.

The gardens include a heated 8m x 4m swimming pool; a variety of flora including tall cedars, centenary olive trees, and cypresses; and automatic drip irrigation supplied by a deep well that also feeds the pool. The property is fully fenced and accessed via electric gates, with covered parking for three vehicles.

Modern installations include ducted air conditioning, underfloor heating, wood-burning stove, water softener, alarm system, garden and exterior lighting, automatic irrigation, smoke detectors, shutters, pool cover, electric gates, and fibre-optic internet connection.

This contemporary villa makes an exceptional private retreat or an attractive rental investment, offering a prime location, refined interiors, and landscaped gardens with a heated pool in complete privacy. The picturesque village of Ménerbes lies less than a kilometre away, with its choice of restaurants, cafés, bars, and shops.
