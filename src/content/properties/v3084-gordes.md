This superbly authentic 19th-century hamlet house, built in 1836, is nestled in a quiet street in the heart of a sought-after hamlet in the commune of Gordes. Combining traditional Provençal character with modern comfort, the property offers an excellent sense of privacy, combined with wonderfully chic and spacious interiors. The house enjoys a delightful walled garden with various terraces and a lovely swimming pool area, making it a perfect main home or easy-to-maintain Luberon retreat.

The ground floor comprises: inviting entrance hall opening on one side to the sun-drenched sitting room, complete with fireplace and arched wrought-iron French doors leading to the courtyard, and on the other side to a spacious contemporary kitchen. Fully renovated with quartz worktops and sleek white cabinetry, the kitchen comfortably accommodates a dining table for hosting dinners.

The first floor comprises: elegant principal suite complete with an adjoining bathroom with bathtub, shower, and, WC; second double bedroom with lovely terracotta floor tiling (currently used as an artist's workshop); shower room with WC and laundry facilities.

The second floor accommodates a gorgeous third bedroom with en-suite shower room and air conditioning, as well as access to an insulated attic (currently used as storage / dressing room). Pretty Luberon views can be enjoyed from this bedroom.

The outdoor spaces are particularly picturesque: a gravelled courtyard, adorned with potted hydrangeas, oleanders, and ferns, offers multiple areas for entertaining. A wrought-iron staircase leads to the upper terrace, where the swimming pool and surrounding terrace provide an idyllic setting for sunbathing and relaxation. Partially sheltered by a traditionally tiled roof, the pool area enjoys sunlight until late afternoon in the summer months.

Amenities include: oil-fired central heating; reversible air conditioning on the second floor; mains water; well water for the garden; fibre-optic internet; wrought-iron and PVC double-glazing; secure access through a large gate allowing for on-site parking, in addition to public parking nearby.

This delightful property offers an exceptional blend of history and modern comfort, with authentic Provençal features such as terracotta floors, exposed beams, and traditional ceilings preserved alongside elegant renovations. Whether as a year-round home or a second home, this house is ideally located in the heart of the Luberon, with privacy, charm, and character in abundance.
