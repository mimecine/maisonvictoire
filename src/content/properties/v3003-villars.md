This exceptional 18-century stone farmhouse rests serenely in the mountains above the charming Luberon village of Villars, providing a haven of peace in an unspoiled rural setting.  A family home for many years, the property has been lovingly and respectfully renovated, with a particular regard for maintaining its innate character and rich heritage, whilst creating intimate indoor spaces for the family.  The choice of natural building materials as well as the considered planting of drought-resistant plants reflect the great care taken to respect the environment.  The clear views of distant villages, and the unpolluted night sky, enhance the property’s unspoilt beauty.

The accommodation, on the ground floor, comprises: entrance hall with its original bread oven, which once fed the village’s entire working population; spacious dining kitchen with a masonry stove; utility room; large cellar; sitting room with cathedral ceiling, generous south-facing windows allowing the winter sun to pour in, and a stove to add to the warmth in winter.

On the first floor: partially laid with exotic dark fraké wood flooring; three bedrooms (the one over the living room has a glassed-in partition to allow in the light from below; family bathroom; two further bedrooms; shower room.

The house’s insulation is almost entirely made up of hemp – roof, walls, and even the floors in some rooms.  Hemp was chosen for its ecological properties and thermal performance which gives the walls a special warmth.  
 
Annexed to the house, with independent access, is an apartment with a generous living space, a bedroom and a shower room.  It enjoys natural light from all four sides of the building and gorgeous views to the south. With its own garden, terraces, and parking area, this apartment offers an entirely separate living space from the main house.  

The front garden is  made up of plants that don’t require watering – chosen in collaboration with the renowned ‘dry gardener’ James Basson, based in Grasse. The stone walls create a micro-climate and an ideal habitat for a diverse fauna.  White and evergreen oaks weave a dappled canopy beneath which one can enjoy an al fresco lunch or some bird-watching.  In the shade of the centennial evergreen oaks in front of the house there is always a welcome breeze coming up from the valley. As dusk settles, the garden is bathed in a golden light.

The stone walls and steps created from locally sourced stone from the valley reflect the deep history of the place.  Set on the slope of the hill the gardens are on several levels.  This adds to the magic of the environment and the restanques (terraced areas) provide many varied opportunities for outdoor living areas, such as the ‘hanging garden’, the parking areas, the vegetable garden (whose soil quality has been improved over the years to create a fertile potager), and olive grove of approximately 20 trees yielding 50 – 100 kg of olives a year.

Amenities include: a wood-burning boiler; fibre optic internet; mains water; rain water collection (150m3); private well; automatic watering system in the potager; outdoor lighting on the terrace, a septic tank and electric fencing.  Additional features include ample parking; extensive storage below the property and an adjacent boiler-room.

This unique property seamlessly weaves together modern comfort with the enduring spirit of an authentic Provençal farmhouse, offering a peaceful retreat in an idyllic corner of the Luberon.  The proximity to Apt, for local supermarkets, and its renowned Saturday outdoor market, as well as Saint-Saturnin-lès-Apt and Villars (home to terrific restaurants, run by innovative young restaurateurs, such as Le Saint Hubert, Le Bar des Amis, and La Fontaine) and the Villars Golf Course (with restaurant and upcoming hotel-spa) adds to the desirability of the location.
