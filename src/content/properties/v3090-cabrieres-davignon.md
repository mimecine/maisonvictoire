This charming early eighteenth-century stone property enjoys a peaceful setting in the heart of the elegant village of Cabrières-d’Avignon. It counts the village castle as its most prestigious neighbour. Only a few minutes’ walk to the grocer’s, the baker’s, and the bistro, the property is set within old stone walls, affording complete privacy. The house offers modern conveniences (bathrooms and A/C in every bedroom), whilst showcasing lovely authentic features in each room: exposed wooden beams, stone interior walls, or original floor tiles.

The ground floor includes two bedroom suites, each accessed independently from the garden. Suite 1 consists of: spacious 27m2 bedroom with fitted cupboards; ensuite shower room; separate WC. Suite 2 consists of: bedroom with ensuite bathroom with bathtub and adjacent WC. Also on this floor: laundry room; separate WC; access to small outdoor terrace.

The first floor, accessed via old stone steps leading up from the garden, features: rustic-style equipped kitchen/dining /sitting room with white-washed ceiling beams, stone walls, and attractive fireplace with stone surround; mezzanine for storage; views of the garden and castle from the window. Also on this floor: principal bedroom with magnificent high ceiling, ensuite bathroom with bathtub, separate WC; bedroom with ensuite shower room. 

Outdoors, the walled garden with its mature trees, oleanders, vines, and other flowering plants is delightfully spacious for a village property, providing various areas for relaxing and enjoying the sunny Provençal weather, either on the deck of the 5m x 3m heated pool, its lawn, or under the shade of the outdoor kitchen. Stately mulberry trees provide a natural canopy in the heat of the day, and the eye is drawn to original features such as the abreuvoir (drinking trough) and well. Discreet outdoor lighting ensures that the garden can be enjoyed into the evening for apéritifs and dinner under the stars.

Amenities include: gas-fired heating and reversible A/C in all the bedrooms; fireplace; wrought-iron window frames on the garden floor; mains drainage; mains water; fibre-optic internet; alarm; automatic watering system; parking for two cars within the property, secured by gates. 

This is a rare opportunity to own a turnkey centuries-old property in the historic heart of Cabrières-d’Avignon. The house ticks all the boxes for lovers of peace and authenticity, yet it is only a few minutes’ drive from the renowned villages of Gordes, Roussillon and Ménerbes. Just an hour from Marseille airport and Avignon TGV, it is ideal as either a main residence, a holiday home, or a rental investment.
