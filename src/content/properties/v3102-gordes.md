Set just a short walk from the historic village of Gordes, with its many restaurants, cafés, and boutiques, this beautiful stone villa perfectly blends Provençal charm with modern comfort. The property has undergone a complete renovation, carried out with exceptional attention to detail and high-quality materials. The result is a contemporary yet character-filled home that offers light-filled interiors, generous proportions, and a landscaped garden ensuring privacy while remaining close to village life.

The entrance opens into a spacious open-plan living area with high ceilings, exposed beams and arched windows that flood the space with natural light. The bespoke kitchen – crafted with ceramic worktops and natural wood cabinetry – flows seamlessly into a spacious dining and sitting area opening directly onto a large, partially covered terrace, ideal for outdoor dining and entertaining.

The ground floor hosts two generous bedroom suites, each with its own ensuite shower room and WC. A utility room and additional WC complete this level.

The first floor accommodates a third suite, with independent access, offering ample built-in storage, a private shower room and WC – ideal for guests or seasonal rentals.

Outside, the landscaped south-west-facing garden features multiple terraces, dry gardens, and a rich variety of native plants and trees. Stone steps lead down to the 9m x 5m swimming pool, framed by a terrace that invites you to relax under the Provençal sun. The property also includes a large tool shed and ample private parking within the garden.

Amenities include reversible air conditioning throughout; mains water and drainage; automatic garden watering system; fibre-optic internet; aluminium-framed double glazing; and automatic gates with intercom.

This is a rare opportunity to own a completely renovated home that combines authenticity, comfort and understated elegance – perfect as a permanent residence, a second home or a highly sought-after seasonal rental in one of the most desirable villages of the Luberon.
