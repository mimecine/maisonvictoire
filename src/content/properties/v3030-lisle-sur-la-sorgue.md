Spacious and drenched in natural light, this stone l’Isle-sur-la-Sorgue property benefits from a terrific location, close to the centre yet away from the bustle of this vibrant Provençal market town. Nestled behind gates and tall hedges, the property enjoys exceptional privacy, complemented by lovely gardens and a superb swimming pool area. The property has been beautifully remodelled, with no expense spared, thoroughly modernising the interiors to the highest standards. The result is a refreshingly contemporary home, ideal for year-round living or as a luxurious Provençal retreat.

The ground floor is composed of: welcoming foyer with guest WC; impressive living area structured around a central fireplace, featuring a generous formal dining area and sitting room - oversized arched French doors lead out to the terrace and swimming pool, seamlessly blending indoor-outdoor living; gorgeous bespoke kitchen adorned with granite countertops, a stunning Lacanche stove, and Zelige tile backsplash - complemented by a small scullery kitchen. The ground floor also accommodates the master suite, with arched wrought-iron French doors and oak flooring, a large adjoining dressing room and bathroom equipped with a freestanding bathtub and walk-in shower.

The first floor comprises three south-facing double bedrooms (the largest measuring 21m²), sharing two spacious bathrooms. Two of these bedrooms currently serve as inspiring office spaces.

A large secondary building (64m²) currently functions as a music room with its own WC. This versatile space could easily be transformed into an independent guest house, lavish private gym, yoga or meditation studio, or artist's atelier. The possibilities are numerous.

A separate guest suite with direct access to the swimming pool provides additional accommodation for guests, featuring air-conditioning and a private shower room with WC.

The property's basement (82m²) houses the heating system, utility space, and wine cellar. Additional storage spaces for garden furniture and equipment are available, including a hand-crafted wooden chalet ideal for storing bicycles.

A large terrace runs along the property's southern façade, shaded by a pergola draped in grape vines, perfect for outdoor dining and entertaining. Steps lead down to the redesigned pool area, featuring a superb 10m x 5m heated swimming pool with electric submerged cover, encompassed by terraces. The fully-equipped summer kitchen (complete with pizza oven, open fireplace, and all necessary appliances) extends into a spacious covered seating area. The garden surrounds the house, ensuring complete privacy, and features a lovely variety of trees, indigenous flowering plants, and manicured shrubs.

Amenities include: carport for several vehicles; underfloor heating and cooling in living spaces; air-conditioning throughout; wood-framed double glazing; StarLink high-speed internet; thermodynamic water boiler; alarm system; mains water supply; Canal de Provence water for the garden; newly installed septic tank. The property is fully fenced and secured by electric gates.

This is an outstanding property, filled with natural light and generous spaces, ideally located near the area's most coveted town - renowned for its Michelin-starred restaurants, celebrated antiques market, and numerous shops. Additionally, the property is within walking distance of a local farmer’s shop offering fresh seasonal produce.
