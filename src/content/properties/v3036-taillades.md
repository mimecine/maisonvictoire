Located on the edge of the charming village of Les Taillades, in the heart of the Luberon, this property of approximately 200 sqm perfectly balances authenticity with modern comfort.

From the moment you step inside, the unique character of the home is revealed through a succession of generously proportioned rooms. The main living area, bathed in natural light, showcases exposed beams and stone walls, creating a warm, refined, and timeless atmosphere.
Adjacent to the living room, a fully equipped professional kitchen meets the highest standards and is complemented by a discreet and practical utility room.
A second living room, featuring original cement tile flooring, has been transformed into a library and offers a more intimate space, ideal for reading or quiet moments of relaxation.  This space can easily be adapted to suit your needs and desires. A hallway flows harmoniously through the ground floor, which also includes a guest toilet.

Upstairs, the 31 sqm master suite enjoys its own private bathroom and benefits from independent access via a staircase leading directly to the main living space. Two additional inviting bedrooms complete this level, along with a dressing room that could easily be converted into a second bathroom, depending on the needs of future owners.

In addition, a 15 sqm air-conditioned guest annex offers a bedroom with en-suite shower and toilet - perfect for hosting family or friends with complete independence. A bright and functional 15 sqm workshop, along with a covered carport, further enhance the outdoor spaces.

The garden, a true haven of greenery, is arranged around a stunning lap pool measuring 13 meters in length and 3 meters in width. Surrounded by majestic century-old plane trees and around forty olive trees, the grounds invite relaxation and contemplation in every season.

Amenities include an automated gate, video intercom, fiber-optic internet, mains water, a well, and automatic irrigation.

Combining peace and proximity to local amenities, this property embodies a discreet and authentic lifestyle in a privileged setting. Whether as a primary residence or a holiday home, it is an ideal place to create lasting memories.
