Set amid the serene landscapes of Oppède, this exceptional Provençal mas combines timeless charm with modern refinement. Behind its striking stone façade lies a home that has been meticulously renovated to the highest standards, using premium materials and showcasing an effortless blend of traditional architecture and contemporary elegance. 

A grand, cypress-lined driveway framed by olive groves and vineyards creates an unforgettable sense of arrival. Through an impressive stone arch and wooden gate, you enter a stunning courtyard centered around a graceful fountain shaded by mature trees - an atmosphere infused with Mediterranean scents and tranquility.

Inside, generous volumes and natural light define the living spaces. Traditional elements – exposed beams, Provencal ceilings, and natural stone archways – blend seamlessly with modern design choices and contemporary materials. The ground floor offers a spacious living room that opens onto the courtyard and pool terrace through large sliding doors, a sleek modern kitchen with a central island flowing into the dining room, two en suite bedrooms, a cozy sitting room with fireplace, guest loo, and utility room.

The grand staircase located in the main entrance leads to the first floor, which hosts two elegant en suite bedrooms and a principal suite with a bathroom, dressing room, and lovely Juliette balcony. A second staircase from the dining room leads to an impressive suite with lofted mezzanine, luxurious en suite bathroom, private terrace with independent courtyard access, and another en suite bedroom and sitting room - perfect for guests or family.

The property also includes a charming independent guest house with open-plan living and kitchen area, mezzanine bedroom, and shower room.

Outdoors, Provençal living is celebrated to perfection: a shaded terrace with summer kitchen overlooks the courtyard, ideal for outdoor dining and entertaining. To the west, a heated 12m x 5m pool blends seamlessly with the stone terrace, offering unobstructed views of the surrounding countryside.

The renovation has been carried out to the highest standard, incorporating underfloor heating and cooling on the ground floor, double insulation, aluminium joinery, seven hot water heaters, and reversible air-conditioning on the first floor for additional comfort. Additional amenities include: wine cellar; mains and well water; automatic watering; electric gates; ample parking with carport; regulation-compliant septic tank.

Every detail of this home has been thoughtfully crafted to combine authenticity, elegance, and modern comfort, offering a lifestyle of unmatched serenity and luxury in the heart of Provence.
