In an unbeatable location for utter peace and quiet, this well-maintained contemporary property is just over five minutes’ drive to the centre of bustling L’Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, famed for its boutiques, restaurants, antique stores and twice-weekly open-air markets.

The ground floor is composed of: entrance hall with closet; open-plan sitting room and dining area with fireplace, opening out to a superb light-filled, air-conditioned fitted kitchen featuring a fan-assisted oven, induction plates and quartz countertops. An ideal spot for gathering family and friends around the sizeable island, the kitchen is south-facing and overlooks the pool, with huge sliding doors leading to the tiled terrace shaded by a motorised bioclimatic style pergola. The ground floor also comprises: two bedrooms with fitted closets; family bath and second WC; office (or bedroom); combined laundry room and back kitchen; guest WC.
 
Adjacent to the main house is an independent studio comprising a bedroom and ensuite shower room. 

The garden, which covers over an acre, is grassed over and planted with mature specimens of native species such as olives and oaks. The 5m x 10m pool is flanked with travertine stone – a beckoning spot to sunbathe or take a dip.  Perfect for keeping small children safe, it is completely secured by a wrought-iron fence and gate. Whether you want to enjoy a meal al fresco, take a nap under a tree, or splash in the pool, this garden has something for everyone.

Amenities include: ducted reversible air conditioning; double-glazing with insect screens in bedrooms and living room; wood-burning fireplace with insert; mains water; septic tank conforming to current regulations; 60m borehole; fibre internet; electric gates; automatic watering system using borehole water. Insulated and tiled garage with electric door; 3-car carport and additional driveway parking space. Garden shed and borie. Crawl space.
  
This home is move-in ready, and full of possibilities for transforming the living space or adding a bedroom. It would serve as a delightful family home, a Luberon retreat (less than an hour from Avignon TGV and Marseille airport) or as an investment property for attractive seasonal rental returns.
