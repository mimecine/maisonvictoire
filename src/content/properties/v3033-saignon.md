Located in the heart of the charming and authentic village of Saignon, this spacious and beautiful village house enjoys a peaceful setting. Shops, bars, and restaurants are within walking distance, and the lively center of Apt, with its famous market, is just 5 minutes away.

The property has recently been extensively renovated, retaining authentic features such as the terracotta tiles, fireplace, Provençal ceilings and wooden beams to create a warm atmosphere.

The roof terrace offers panoramic views of the Luberon, with magical sunsets in the evening. A private, sunny and sheltered south-west facing garden with a 4m x 7m swimming pool is unique for a village house. A vaulted terrace provides shade and shelter on hot summer days. 

With over 70 m² of cellar space, including a wine cellar accessible from the house, there is plenty of storage space. Several cellars are located at street level, allowing easy storage of bicycles.

The property is accessible by car year-round for dropping off and picking up directly at the door. There is ample parking less than 300 meters away.

The ground floor consists of: a sunny bedroom with an adjoining shower room; separate entrance on the ground floor leading to an apartment with a comfortable sitting area, a fully equipped kitchen, a guest toilet and a spacious bedroom with a shower room and a romantic private balcony.

The ground floor provides access to the vaulted terrace and garden and also includes a technical room and access to the wine cellar.

The first floor houses a large living space with a living room, a dining room with a fireplace, and an open kitchen. The large windows in the dining area offer breathtaking views of the Luberon. The sitting room, both spacious and intimate, opens onto the large terrace, also featuring floor-to-ceiling windows to maximize natural light and take full advantage of the view. 

This partially covered terrace faces southwest to enjoy the sun all day, all year round. With an outdoor barbecue and magnificent sunsets, it's the perfect place to enjoy Provençal evenings with friends and family.

On the second floor is the master bedroom with en-suite shower room, where you can retreat in complete privacy and once again enjoy the panoramic view.

Recently installed technical equipment includes: oil-fired condensing heating and hot water boiler; air conditioning with a heat pump in the living room and ground-floor apartment; double glazing with wooden joinery adding a traditional aesthetic; fibre internet; and large storage spaces spread across four cellars.

The ground floor appartement with a private entrance is ideal for seasonal rental.

This fantastic property is ideal for those seeking the liveliness of one of the most charming villages of the Luberon, but also peace and quiet with panoramic views in their own home.
