Located in the very heart of the picturesque village of Cabrières-d’Avignon, in the Luberon, this attractive 18th-century property offers a wealth of character and traditional Provençal charm. Behind its handsome stone façade lies a property of generous scale, offering bright, well-proportioned rooms, several private terraces and a large courtyard. Formerly used for commercial purposes, it now presents an exceptional opportunity to create a spacious, comfortable and wonderfully authentic  village home. Though some reconfiguration and upgrades will be required, the potential is outstanding, and houses of this size, proportion and stature are rarely available in the village.

The ground floor is composed of: elegant drawing room with decorative mouldings and beautiful oak parquet flooring that brings warmth to this space; living space lined with wrought-iron French windows opening to the courtyard - an ideal future kitchen; professional kitchen with adjoining cold room; guest WC. The large volumes, and flexible layout ensure that the property would be well suited as a family home, a large Luberon retreat, or a lucrative seasonal rental investment.

The first floor provides three generous suites, each with its own shower room and WC - one also benefits from a lovely private roof terrace.

The second floor offers two further suites. The first comprises a large bedroom with a private sitting area, a roof terrace, and a bathroom with bathtub and shower. The second, a duplex, includes a bedroom and shower room, with an internal staircase rising to a study (or private salon) set beneath wide windows that frame incredible views of the Luberon valley.

The courtyard affords a generous outdoor living area, currently fitted with pergolas draped with vines, a summer kitchen and a fountain. The space could accommodate a swimming pool or bassin - an inviting and quiet setting.

Works and imagination would be required to needed to unleash the property’s full potential, but the combination of gorgeous original features, excellent ceiling heights and a prime position in the heart of a sought-after Luberon village ensures that this property will stand out. Cabrières-d’Avignon is an authentic village surrounded by vineyards and protected landscapes, moments from Gordes, Ménerbes, Goult, Roussillon and L’Isle-sur-la-Sorgue - one of Provence’s most desirable locations.
