Located in the peaceful countryside of Oppède – a short drive from the shops and weekly market of Coustellet and the perched villages of Ménerbes and Oppède-le-Vieux – this Provençal farmhouse has undergone a complete and masterful renovation, blending authentic charm with contemporary comfort. Offering four generous air-conditioned suites, a heated swimming pool and a garage, and set amid private woodland, orchards and rolling hills, the property enjoys absolute privacy and sweeping views towards the rugged Luberon mountains.

The ground floor is composed of: entrance hall with fitted cupboards and guest WC; bright sitting room with open fireplace and wrought-iron French doors opening directly onto the main dining terrace and walled garden; contemporary Fabre kitchen equipped with a Lacanche induction range, featuring exposed stone walls and an adjoining rear kitchen / pantry. A guest suite completes the ground floor, benefiting from an en suite shower room and direct access to the garden.

The upper floors are divided into two wings, each served by its own staircase. The first staircase, rising from the sitting room, serves: principal suite of generous proportions with adjoining shower room and WC; spacious double bedroom with bathroom fitted with a bathtub, walk-in shower, double vanity and WC. The second staircase serves: one further double suites, with its own shower room; cathedral-ceilinged sitting room with lovely original beams – equally suited as a fifth bedroom or office.

The gardens have been landscaped into a series of welcoming outdoor spaces, including a wonderfully private walled garden wrapped around the swimming pool. The heated pool (12m × 4m), fitted with a submerged cover, is surrounded by natural stone terraces and enjoys lovely views over the surrounding countryside. A raised terrace accommodates a fully equipped summer kitchen – ideal for outdoor dining and entertaining – while additional terraces, some shaded by a gorgeous pine tree, provide a choice of relaxing spots throughout the day. The plots of land to the south offer further potential (orchard, truffle oaks, vines, etc.).

Amenities include: reversible air-conditioning; mains water; newly installed septic system; fibre-optic internet; wood and wrought-iron double-glazed windows. The property also benefits from a 35 m² garage with electric door and electric car charging point, together with a separate carport.

Thanks to its stylish renovation, four en-suite bedrooms and myriad of outdoor living areas, this property offers an elegant and private Provençal retreat with excellent seasonal-rental potential.
