In a bucolic setting on the edge of a peaceful hamlet just a few kilometres from the sought-after village of Roussillon, this superb stone bastide embodies all the authentic charm of the Luberon. Offering a breathtaking panorama over Gordes, Joucas and the gentle hills of the Luberon, the property enjoys an exceptionally beautiful environment where the tranquillity of nature blends seamlessly with the magic of Provençal landscapes. Surrounded by a magnificent landscaped plot covering more than an acre, the property stands out with its handsome historic façade, generous volumes, and warm, elegant atmosphere. The whole exudes a timeless quality while offering excellent modern comfort.

The ground floor comprises: a spacious open-plan living area with kitchen and dining room; a bright sitting room with fireplace opening onto a panoramic terrace with stunning views; a utility room; and guest WC.

Bordered by mature trees and natural hedges, the garden offers both sunny and shaded corners to fully enjoy the Provençal way of life — all while taking in superb views of the surrounding rolling countryside.
