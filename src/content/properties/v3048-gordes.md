This handsome stone property, poised in oak woodlands near Gordes, enjoys a remarkably tranquil setting and commands uninterrupted panoramas over the Luberon valley, from sunrise to sunset. The interiors have been meticulously remodelled, integrating high-quality fittings and natural materials with a fantastic array of modern comforts - contemporary living at its finest amid unspoilt countryside. Gordes and Coustellet are only a few kilometres away, and both the TGV station and the airport are within easy reach.

Arranged on a single level, the living spaces and bedrooms are bathed in natural light and oriented to capture the view. The entrance opens into a welcoming double-height living room, with views straight through and over to the Luberon mountains. Aged beams, a characterful stone fireplace and Maize stone floors lend warmth and authenticity. The sitting area flows into the dining kitchen, crafted by a local cabinet-maker and topped with marble work surfaces. Both spaces spill out onto south-facing dining terraces overlooking the valley below - an extraordinary backdrop for al-fresco meals and entertaining guests. A WC and cloakroom complete the entrance hall.

The west wing accommodates a luxurious principal suite: beautifully proportioned bedroom, a bathroom with freestanding tub and generous walk-in shower clad in hand-cut Zellige, a private office and ample built-in storage and closets. The east side of the property offers three further bedrooms, each with its own stylish shower room finished in the same artisan tiling, double vanity units and quality fittings, guaranteeing consistent comfort throughout.

The landscaped grounds seem to merge with the Luberon mountains, with no neighbouring roofs in sight, creating an exceptional sense of privacy. The 10m × 5m swimming pool faces the view and is edged by decking, perfect for sun lounging and pool-side entertaining; an electric cover ensures safety. The 3.4-acre plot has been designed for ease of upkeep, featuring dry plantings, mature olive trees and a pocket of private oak forest. A garden studio, lined with wrought-iron windows, offers an inspiring space for creative work.

Amenities include: air-conditioning and central heating; under-floor heating in the bathrooms for additional comfort; high-speed fibre-optic internet; mains water; private water source; automated irrigation; recently installed septic tank; wood-framed double glazing; electric perimeter fence and automatic entrance gates.

This impeccably re-imagined stone house occupies a sublime natural setting and delivers a rare balance of seclusion and convenience, close to vibrant villages and all amenities. Meticulous attention to detail and design elevates the property, making it a tremendously chic and stand-out home in the heart of Provence.
