This charming stone hideaway boasts an excellent location in the highly sought-after Ménerbes countryside, just a short distance from local bars, restaurants, cafés, and shops.

Recently renovated with care, it blends modern touches with traditional character and offers an authentic, comfortable retreat with charming interiors, good volumes and a beautifully landscaped garden. The property showcases breathtaking and unobstructed views of the Luberon.

The accommodation, on the ground floor, comprises: entrance hall; open-plan living space and an elegant kitchen, generous dining area, and a cosy sitting room with impressive wooden beams; utility room; master bedroom with adjoining bathroom and double aspect windows granting stunning views; double bedroom; guest shower room and WC. The dining room opens out onto an expansive terrace, adorned with a pergola draped in grape vines, overlooking the valley below. The kitchen leads out to a covered terrace, featuring authentic parefeuille flooring and large windows offering beautiful views of the garden.

The first floor consists of two double bedrooms and a modern shower room. The property also features an independent studio on the lower floor with great potential for renovation and decorative works.

Amenities include: mains water; automatic watering system; exterior lighting; fibre-optic internet; wood-framed double glazing. The roof has recently been inspected and partially redone.

The garden is an absolute triumph: it features beautiful stone walls and stone-paved paths lined with lavender. The pièce de résistance is the 12 m x 5 m swimming pool equipped with a submerged cover, walled and planted to ensure complete privacy. Olive trees on one side set the scene, while a drystone wall topped with lavender and roses adds fragrant scents and vibrant colour. Landscaping has been carefully planned to create a sense of space and light throughout the property.

Offering panoramic Luberon views and tranquil surroundings, this property provides an idyllic Provençal experience within easy reach of Ménerbes.
