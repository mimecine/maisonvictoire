Within walking distance of the lively Luberon village of Robion, this striking bastide has been thoughtfully renovated and redesigned. Offering generous living spaces and vast reception rooms, the property exudes character and charm, ensuring terrific flexibility for hosting guests and strong business potential. Arranged around a central walled garden, the property comprises a gorgeous main house (the bastide), several independent suites, a gîte, and large reception rooms – perfect for seminars, artistic or yoga retreats, or accommodating guests on a large scale.

Main House (the bastide)
The ground floor is composed of: kitchen with dining area; 51sqm sitting room featuring a second dining area and a gorgeous old well; wine cellar and larder.

The first floor comprises: two spacious suites, each benefitting from a private shower room; office space; two additional bedrooms sharing a Jack-and-Jill bathroom and WC.

The second floor accommodates a generous principal suite, complete with its own bathroom (with bath and walk-in shower) and a large dressing room. Lovely views of the Luberon mountains can be enjoyed from this suite. An independent wing of the property (still on the second floor) offers two further bedrooms with shared bathroom and WC.

Guest suites
Three independent suites, each with a separate entrance and great privacy, ensure flexibility and comfort for guests:

– The first includes a sitting room, bedroom, bathroom with bathtub, shower and WC, and a private terrace.
– The second comprises a bedroom with en suite bathroom and WC.
– The third offers a bedroom with its own bathroom and WC.

Gîte
The gîte features a kitchen, dining room, sitting room, WC, two bedrooms and a shower room – ideal for guests or extended stays.

Reception rooms
A recently converted space (over 80sqm) provides the perfect spot for seminars or entertaining on a larger scale. This versatile area is equipped with a kitchen, storage room and WC. A second space, with gorgeous original features and high cathedral ceilings, is currently used for serving breakfast and meals to B&B guests. Guests are also provided with a separate fully equipped kitchen, and a laundry room.

The outdoor spaces are equally inviting, with generous terraces, a bright glass-covered veranda, a sauna and a jacuzzi. The 8m x 4m bassin-style swimming pool, heated and secured with a submerged cover, is separated from the bastide by colourful oleanders and fragrant jasmine.

A vast garage completes the property, with a large workshop area, ample parking for cars (2 - 3 cars) – with potential for additional conversion.
