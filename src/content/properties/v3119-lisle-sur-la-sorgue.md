Just five minutes from the vibrant cafés and antique markets of L’Isle-sur-la-Sorgue - and only 30 minutes from the Avignon TGV and 45 minutes from Marseille Airport - this exceptional Provençal estate offers a rare combination of historical character, accessibility, and established business potential.

Set within 2.8 acres of landscaped grounds, the property centers around a former 14th-century priory whose quiet elegance has been carefully preserved. Spanning approximately 787 m², the residence blends authentic architectural features with the comfort and functionality required for both private living and hospitality use.

The ground floor is designed around elegant reception and operational spaces. It opens onto an entrance hall leading to a charming petit salon, ideal for guest reception or quiet moments. A fully equipped professional Fabre kitchen, complete with an arrière-cuisine, allows for seamless commercial operation. A grand salon with fireplace and a spacious dining room provide warm, inviting areas for entertaining or hosting guests. This floor also includes an independent gite with its own kitchen, en-suite bathroom and private terrace. An additional bedroom suite, with en-suite bathroom and private terrace, as well as laundry facilities, guest WC, and technical room complete this level. 

The upper floors are dedicated to accommodation and flexibility of use. They comprise eight additional bedroom suites, all with en-suite bathrooms, offering comfort and privacy for guests. An independent apartment - featuring a kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, and WC - provides ideal accommodation for an owner, manager, or staff. A storage room completes these floors.

The landscaped gardens offer a peaceful and refined outdoor setting, featuring a heated 16m × 6m swimming pool surrounded by generous terraces, ideal for relaxation. A natural spring, 14 meters deep, supplies the automatic irrigation system. A dedicated spa area - including hammam, sauna, jacuzzi, shower, and WC - adds an additional layer of luxury and wellness appeal.

Additional outbuildings, including an outdoor gym and pool house, provide further potential for expansion or creative use.

Currently operated as a boutique hotel, the property benefits from a strong reputation and proven income, allowing for an immediate continuation of the business or the development of a bespoke hospitality or wellness concept.

Steeped in history yet perfectly suited to modern use, this rare estate stands out for its charm, strategic location, and exceptional commercial potential - an outstanding opportunity in one of Provence’s most sought-after regions.
