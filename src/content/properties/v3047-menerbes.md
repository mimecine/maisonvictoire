This historic property, with unobstructed south-facing views of the Luberon, enjoys a coveted spot on a quaint cobblestone street, just steps away from the highest point of Ménerbes, one of the much-prized perched villages in the renowned Golden Triangle. A former convent, the property’s neighbours are the imposing clocktower and similar centuries-old buildings, gorgeous examples of the noble and ornate stonework of medieval architecture. The house is freshly redecorated, yet particular attention has been paid to preserving the authenticity of the property, such as for the lovely floor in the sitting room.

The property comprises on the ground floor: spacious entrance hall leading to the authentic stairwell; buanderie and cave. 

On the first floor: sitting room of calming aesthetic simplicity, as befits a former convent, with its graceful arches, old double wooden doors, stone fireplace and tall windows looking out to the mountains; kitchen (with access to its own 20m2 terrace) fitted with wooden cabinets and granite countertops and equipped with a fridge, dishwasher, cooktop, oven and microwave; guest WC.

On the second floor: spacious master bedroom with its decorative fireplace and plentiful cupboards; bathroom with tub, shower, sink and WC; office space (could serve as a bedroom) with access to upper terrace.  

Up a small flight of stairs is a further bedroom with shower and terrace, offering endless possibilities for customisation. Enjoy views over to Le Mourre Nègre – the highest point of the Luberon!

Amenities include: electric heating; fireplace; ADSL internet; mains water; mains drainage. 

This is a unique property which has been lovingly maintained and renovated over the years, whilst retaining many of its original features including traditional tiles, doors and the fireplace. With three separate terraces and gorgeous views, this house, with abundant Provençal charm, is a must-have for lovers of French village life, and, of course, fans of Peter Mayle’s ‘A Year in Provence’.
