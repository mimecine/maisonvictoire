This lovely property is a ten minute walk from the village of Lagnes, a lively year-round traditional Luberon village with everything to offer, including: bars and restaurants, a bakery, a hairdresser’s, a pharmacy and doctor’s office. Set in lovely grounds against a breathtaking backdrop of the Vaucluse mountains, the house’s views are unspoilt, whether through the generous French windows or from the terrace and poolside. This house was designed to let the natural sunlight bathe its bright décor and very spacious rooms, and to enjoy life indoors and outdoors, year-round.

The house’s interior is chic, yet a whimsical ode to colour, dedicated to entertaining and relaxing in style. 

The ground floor comprises: attractive entrance hall leading to three adjoining living rooms, one featuring a cosy wood-burning stove, another serving as a TV room; spacious combined kitchen and dining room with exterior doors (39m2); laundry room and storage space which could serve as an additional bedroom or office. A fabulous glass ceilinged sunroom (31m2), flooded with natural light, invites you to relax in any season, whilst a large reception room (90 m2), boasting bar, kitchen and stage, creates a warm and friendly atmosphere, completing this elegant ensemble.

Also on the ground floor: master bedroom with walk-in closet, sink and toilet, and shower/hammam. A second bedroom also features its own shower room with WC, and sink. Switch this and add doors out to pool area framing a superb view.

The first floor accommodates: generous principal suite with walk-in closet, bathroom with tub and double sink. Two other bedrooms with ensuite shower rooms complete this floor, giving complete privacy to each family member.

Outside, the garden extends over more than an acre and presents a choice of areas to find shade or sun to enjoy the clement south of France weather all year round. The heated mosaic-tiled pool, 12m x 5 m, is flanked by a shaded pergola and a tiled surround with plenty of room for sun loungers and an outdoor table for al fresco dining.

Amenities include: reversible air conditioning throughout; double glazing; mains water and Canal de Provence water for the garden; automatic watering system; fibre internet; visiophone; ample private parking.

This unique house ticks all the boxes for buyers seeking a turnkey property in close proximity to the lively market town of L’Isle-sur-la-Sogue, the airport and Avignon TGV station, yet secluded enough to enjoy entertaining family and friends in complete privacy. Equally suited to being a sizeable family home, a second residence, or a lucrative rental in the heart of the Luberon, this gem is not to be missed!
