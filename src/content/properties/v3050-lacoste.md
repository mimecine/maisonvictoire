Nestled at the edge of the picturesque hilltop village of Lacoste, in the heart of the Luberon's sought-after Golden Triangle, this charming 17th-century stone cottage sits on a 1.62-acre plot enhanced by a swimming pool. Ideally located, the property offers a peaceful setting within a short distance of the village's shops and amenities.

The property is composed of two separate buildings connected by a terrace and balcony, allowing for great flexibility in the layout.

The main house, arranged over two levels, offers: sitting room with a gorgeous old stone archway, a fireplace and French doors granting direct access to the outdoors; adjoining dining room; kitchen with an additional dining area; a cosy TV room; a shower room with WC; and a study.

The first floor is composed of: three bedrooms; bathroom; WC.

In a separate wing, easily accessible via the connecting terrace, an en-suite bedroom benefits from its own private entrance and a kitchenette - ideal for hosting guests or family in complete privacy. This part of the house is located above a 28 m² garage, offering generous storage space or the possibility of housing a classic or collector’s vehicle.

Outside, the natural, shaded garden, dotted with pine trees, invites you to relax to the soothing sound of cicadas. The 12m x 6m swimming pool and pétanque court sit harmoniously within this quintessentially Provençal setting.

Amenities: electric heating; wood-burning stove; single glazing; mains water; custom-made fly screens.

Some refreshing and renovation work will allow the full potential of this charming property to be revealed - a true haven of peace in Provence.
