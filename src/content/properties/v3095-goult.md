Perched at the top of the sought-after village of Goult, just steps from the historic windmill, this beautifully renovated stone studio offers a rare combination of authentic Provençal charm, refined materials, and breathtaking views over the Luberon valley. Goult is one of the most desirable villages in the region, known for its vibrant atmosphere and multiple amenities - including a bakery, small grocery store, cheese shop, butcher's shop, boutiques, and restaurants - all within walking distance of the property. 

The house was the subject of a complete renovation, completed in 2024, using only the highest-quality materials. Egyptian stone floors, Portuguese marble kitchen countertops with vintage Italian stone sink and unlaquered deVol tap, and Chabaud beams and floorboards blend seamlessly with Portes Antiques doors and carefully chosen finishes, creating a home that feels both character-filled and contemporary. 

The lower level comprises a kitchen designed with both practicality and elegance in mind, alongside a charming bathroom featuring a classic clawfoot tub. Upstairs, a lofted bedroom with integrated closet space makes clever use of its open layout and natural light, offering comfort while maintaining the studio's cozy charm. 

One of the property's rarest features is its private 150m² garden - a peaceful haven with a stone fountain, lush plantings, and panoramic valley views. Whether enjoying a morning coffee, an evening apéritif, or a quiet afternoon under the Provençal sun, this outdoor space makes the home truly special. 

Amenities include: reversible air-conditioning; electric hot water heater; mains water and drainage; double-glazed windows; automatic watering and drip irrigation in the garden; fiber internet. 

Perfect as a romantic pied-à-terre, an idyllic holiday home, or a charming gîte, this stone retreat captures the very essence of village living in Provence - where history, lifestyle, and craftsmanship meet in a setting of rare beauty.
