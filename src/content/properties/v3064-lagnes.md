A recent build in the traditional style by local craftsmen, using materials sourced from the area (such as Gordes and Ménerbes stone), this property is utterly adorable, tucked away in a quiet corner of Lagnes yet within walking distance of the village centre. Lagnes is a lively year-round traditional Luberon village with everything to offer, including: bars and restaurants, a bakery, a hairdresser’s, a pharmacy and doctor’s office. The views towards the Alpilles, Luberon and Ventoux from the garden are gorgeous. 

The house’s location is ideal for enjoying all that the Luberon has to offer: exploring the area’s famed perched villages, or spending a day in the bustling nearby town of L’Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, with its boutiques, restaurants, antique stores and twice-weekly open-air markets. 

The ground floor is composed of: light-filled open-plan sitting and dining area with electric fireplace, lined with French windows leading to a large shaded terrace. A practical breakfast bar separates the room from the charming kitchen nook. Fully equipped (including a wine fridge) it has exposed stone walls, a typical Provençal ceiling, and a wrought-iron framed window to the entrance hall, letting in more light. A door leads out to a further terrace for outdoor dining. The ground floor also comprises an office, laundry and storage room, and guest WC.

The first floor comprises: main bedroom with dressing room (plans exist to transform this into an ensuite shower room). Two further bedrooms each with fitted wardrobes; family bathroom with double sink, tub and shower; separate WC. The stairs leading to the first floor are made of Ménerbes stone, with risers set with attractive contrasting tiles.

The garden, which covers half an acre, is planted with mature specimens of native species such as olives, oaks, figs, oleanders, agapanthus and hydrangeas. It slopes gently down from the property, towards the secluded pool area with its beckoning summer kitchen equipped with a sink, fridge and grill. Whether you want to relax with friends on the shaded terrace, enjoy a meal al fresco, or sun yourself by the saltwater pool (9.5m x 4m), you will relish the privacy and the peace and quiet.

Amenities include: reversible A/C units with heat pump; gas-fired central heating; electric fireplace; mains water and drainage; fibre internet; alarm and security cameras; electric gates; automatic watering system using Canal de Provence water. Ample parking and carport for 2 cars with shed. Crawl space. Summer kitchen. Pétanque court.

A home to be lived in and loved through every season — ready to move into, and brimming with charm. It would serve as a delightful Luberon retreat (less than an hour from Avignon TGV and Marseille airport) or as an investment property for attractive seasonal rental returns.
