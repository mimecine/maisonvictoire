Just a few minutes by car from the centre of the renowned village of Gordes, this contemporary property offers an exceptional lifestyle with its generous volumes, high-end amenities and refined décor. Both elegant and comfortable, this is a sophisticated house, remarkable for the natural light that pours through it and the high quality of its building materials. The spectacular views from the bedrooms and the one-of-a-kind terrace, as well as the careful choice of the finishes and furnishings, will entice any buyer seeking a well-designed contemporary property.

The accommodation comprises, on the ground floor: impressive living area (sitting room with adjacent dining room), bathed in light from the generous French windows; mezzanine with impressive high ceilings giving a fabulous sense of space. The stone floor and neutral tones are warmly accented with contemporary colours. A modern kitchen with spacious utility room, and a separate bedroom suite with independent laundry room complete this floor.

The first floor is composed of: generously proportioned principal bedroom with en suite bathroom and private terrace – affording stunning panoramic views – and two dressing rooms; mezzanine office overlooking the living area; two further bedrooms, one of which has a terrace; family bathroom; separate WC.

The beautifully laid-out garden has been designed with relaxation and conviviality in mind. The heated 11m x 3.5m pool has a wide stone surround. A covered terrace extends the interior living space to enjoy indoor/outdoor living year-round; a summer kitchen and outdoor shower room complete the picture. Thanks to the under-floor heating already installed, this terrace could be closed-in and converted to become an additional room.

Amenities include: heating with heat pump; thermodynamic water heater; aluminium window and door frames; water softener; alarm; town water and automatic watering system using well water; fibre optic internet. The property also has a large carport and garage (heating system installed here) with storage for garden tools.

Nestled in an unspoiled, peaceful location, this contemporary house presents a rare opportunity to enjoy an elegant yet smooth-running lifestyle. Absolutely turnkey, it is perfect for family life and welcoming guests to share the joys of modern living in the Luberon.
