South-facing and full of character, it captures the essence of Provençal living and offers the most breathtaking view of the village of Gordes and the surrounding Luberon valley. The property includes a 425 m² constructible plot of land facing the village with an unrivalled view.

The ground floor comprises: kitchen; sitting room; shower room with utility facilities. The ground floor opens out onto a terrace that overlooks Gordes and the Luberon valley - an ideal spot for morning coffee or an evening glass of rosé.

The first floor accommodates two bedrooms, one of which enjoys a private balcony offering an incredible panorama of the surrounding countryside.

The house sits on a rare constructible plot of land (approximately 425 m²), providing the option to expand the existing property or add features such as a swimming pool, guesthouse or garage.
