Located in the old quarter of Simiane-la-Rotonde, a stone’s throw from the castle, and walking distance from the bakery and restaurants, this adorable property, a former post office, is the perfect marriage of authenticity and modern comfort.The views are drop-dead gorgeous. Behind its traditional stone façade, the interiors have been thoughtfully reimagined to offer a light, airy and elegant living space.

The ground floor accommodates: fully-renovated kitchen with exposed stone walls; dining room; guest loo; spacious dining terrace.

The first floor enjoys: sitting room; south-facing terrace with incredible views.

The second floor offers: pretty bedroom with closet space; shower room.

Clean lines and a Provençal palette enhance the sense of space and calm, while carefully preserved original features —exposed stone walls, ‘tommette’ tiles – provide character and charm.

Behind the house, down old stone steps, is a private garden with plenty of space for raised vegetable beds, outdoor dining, a hamac in the shade and glorious 180° views.

Amenities include: reversible A/C; double glazing and wooden window frames; fibre optic internet; mains water; mains drainage. On the lower level, there is a further 27m² of utility space with laundry. Free public parking just steps away.

The renovation reflects a deep respect for the house’s history, with a harmonious blend of old and new: sleek contemporary fittings sit comfortably alongside rustic elements.  Enjoy the delightful street-side terrace for watching the va-et-vient, or relax in the shade in the garden, overlooking the valley. With its undeniable character and breath-taking views, this property offers comfortable and convenient living, in an historic Luberon village.
