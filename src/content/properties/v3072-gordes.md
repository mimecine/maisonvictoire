This superbly renovated stone property enjoys an exceptional location, perched above the renowned village of Gordes, within walking distance of the local restaurants, cafes, bars and shops. Entirely renovated in 2024 to an exceptional standard, the property combines bespoke craftsmanship, exquisite choice of materials, and striking architectural features to create a unique Luberon retreat. The property offers unrivalled panoramic views stretching from the Alpilles mountain range to Mont Saint Victoire to the south, and across to the easternmost point of the Luberon valley. Likely the finest view the Luberon has to offer.

At the centre of the property lies an impressive open-plan living space, comprising a voluminous sitting room with insert fireplace, a dining area, and a bespoke kitchen with marble countertops, fitted cupboards and high-quality appliances. Vast motorised patio doors open fully to reveal the landscape beyond, framing panoramic views of the Alpilles, the Luberon valley and Mont Saint Victoire. This incredible living space opens directly onto a large dining and seating terrace, overlooking the valley below. Adjoining the kitchen, a utility room offers additional fitted storage, a wine fridge, and laundry appliances.

The ground floor further comprises: double bedroom with ensuite shower room, featuring Zellige tiling and a walk-in shower; second double bedroom with a Juliette balcony and adjoining bathroom with walk-in shower, bathtub and WC; private office; meditation/yoga room; guest WC.

The first floor is composed of a spacious principal suite, offering a double bedroom with fitted cupboards, a beautifully appointed shower room, and a private rooftop terrace that commands a spectacular panorama – as far as the eye can reach, from east to west. The first floor also accommodates a large mezzanine living space, with office area and artistic workspace.

The garden level provides independent guest accommodation, composed of a fully equipped kitchen and two generously proportioned double bedrooms, each with a shower room ensuite. This level also includes a large storage area and direct access to the garden.

The south-facing gardens have been thoughtfully landscaped to include a generous variety of Provencal plantings, including rose beds, centenary olive trees (producing your very own oil), a mature fig tree, and a charming vegetable garden. A superb 15m x 5m heated saltwater swimming pool with submerged cover enjoys far-reaching views of the surrounding countryside, with an expansive terrace. A covered dining terrace, petanque court, extensive exterior lighting, and private woodland complete the gardens.

Amenities include: underfloor heating/cooling throughout; mains water and mains drainage; air-conditioning; fibre-optic internet; double glazing; comprehensive alarm system; electric gates; carport for two vehicles; automatic watering system.

This elegant and remarkably well-located stone property offers a rare combination of tranquillity, spectacular views, and easy access to one of the most sought-after villages in the Luberon.
