This elegant Provençal farmhouse, with origins dating back to the early 19th century, has been carefully restored, preserving its authentic character while offering generous volumes and modern comfort. Set in the countryside of Les Taillades, this Luberon property enjoys a peaceful rural setting within easy reach of village life, amenities, and the Luberon mountains.

Offering approximately 360m2 of living space and nearly 470m2 of total usable area, the house is arranged to allow both a natural sense of flow and a high degree of independence between living areas, making it ideally suited to family life, hosting guests, or a hospitality project. 

The main entrance opens into a large and welcoming hall with original stone staircase and guest WC, leading to a charming sitting room with fireplace where period features have been carefully preserved. The primary kitchen is complemented by a substantial pantry and utility area housing the boiler room, providing excellent practicality for everyday living or entertaining.

Upstairs, a spacious landing currently used as a games or TV room leads to a comfortable and flexible sleeping arrangement. This floor comprises: principal suite with dressing area and large ensuite bathroom with walk-in shower; two additional suites with adjoining shower rooms; two double bedrooms sharing a shower room; bedroom currently used as dressing room; large attic space. 

A second kitchen and dining room, accessible both independently from the exterior and internally via a secondary staircase, creates a fully autonomous living space, ideal for hosting family or guests in complete privacy or for rental use. Additional ground-floor spaces include a laundry room and cellar. 

The property sits within an enclosed and beautifully maintained garden of approximately .37 acres. A large shaded terrace extends from the house, ideal for outdoor dining, overlooking the heated 11m x 3m swimming pool set within lawned gardens planted with olive trees. The outdoor areas also include an outdoor shower, chicken coop, discreetly positioned pool technical room, WC and enclosed vegetable garden.

Several outbuildings add further value and versatility to the property, including: large garage of approximately 40m2, air-conditioned bureau of 40m2 with independent access and WC, which could easily be converted into a guest studio or small gîte; multiple workshops and storage spaces. Parking is available for several vehicles, with a carport completing the exterior amenities.

Amenities include: double glazing; heated swimming pool; oil-fired central heating; reversible air conditioning in all bedrooms; fiber-optic internet; mains water; private well; automatic irrigation; jacuzzi; electric gate; videophone; electric vehicle charging point; CO₂ water softener.

Ideally located in a calm and natural environment while remaining close to shops, cafés, and restaurants, this character-filled farmhouse offers a rare opportunity to enjoy an authentic yet highly adaptable home in the Luberon.
