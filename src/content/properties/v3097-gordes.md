This superb stone property enjoys an exceptional position just above one of the most prized villages the Luberon has to offer, within walking distance of the local shops, cafés and restaurants. The house commands a spectacular panorama, with far-reaching views across the Luberon Valley to Mont Sainte-Victoire. Designed and built in 2010 with meticulous attention to detail, the property combines the authentic character of a Provençal hamlet with understated contemporary refinement and comfort.

Upon entry, you are greeted by an impressive double-height entrance hall, framing the view over the valley and flowing effortlessly through to the living spaces. The ground floor comprises: grand sitting room with central fireplace and oversized wrought-iron French windows; sleek modern kitchen with black granite worktops, island dining unit, and adjoining scullery kitchen; cosy secondary sitting room with fireplace; guest WC. The ground floor also features a double bedroom suite with shower room, and a large office that could readily serve as an additional bedroom. The pipework for a bathroom has already been installed in the small room adjacent to the office. Each of the ground floor living areas opens onto vast terraces with covered dining and seating areas, oriented towards the extraordinary view.

The first floor accommodates a luxurious principal suite, comprising a large double bedroom, dressing room, light-filled office, and bathroom with double vanity, freestanding bathtub, and walk-in shower. The suite opens onto a private south-facing terrace with stone steps leading down to the dining terraces and swimming pool below. Two further double bedrooms, each with an adjoining bathroom or shower room and access to a private rooftop terrace, complete the first floor.

The garden level provides independent accommodation ideal for guests, with generous reception spaces opening directly onto the pool area. This floor includes: a living space lined with patio doors (66 m² - currently used as a games room); an additional living area that could be fitted as a secondary kitchen; utility room; shower room; guest WC; and two gorgeous double bedroom suites with en suite shower rooms and arched French windows overlooking the gardens, with direct access to the swimming pool.

The grounds extend over 2.6 acres and have been beautifully landscaped to provide complete privacy and an impressive variety of outdoor living areas. The focal point is a magnificent 18m × 5m heated swimming pool surrounded by generous sunbathing terraces, complemented by intimate seating areas, expansive dining terraces, and views that stretch endlessly across the Luberon. A lovely meandering path leads through the gardens, complemented by a superb array of colourful Provençal plantings, drystone walls, mature olive trees, and green lawns. An olive grove with over 100 mature trees produces the property's own olive oil.

Amenities include: underfloor heating and cooling throughout (Bourgogne stone on the ground floor and oak flooring in the first-floor bedrooms); air conditioning in the bedrooms; wrought-iron double glazing; mains water and drainage; fibre-optic internet; electric gates; automatic watering system; water softener; sophisticated alarm system; fully fenced garden; covered parking.

Of exceptional calibre and set in one of the most sought-after locations in the Luberon, this exquisite property combines timeless Provençal architecture with refined contemporary design and incredible views.
