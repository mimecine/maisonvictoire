Situated at the edge of the village of Taillades, this charming stone house, formerly a "bergerie", is located in a quiet residential area. Behind its handsome carriage gates lies a completely private walled garden with an inviting swimming pool area, and separate atelier. The house has been lovingly rebuilt by the current owner, preserving many stunning original Provençal features. It offers both charm and convenience, close to the bustling town of L’Isle-sur-la-Sorgue with its rail link to Marseille airport and proximity to Avignon TGV station.  

The ground floor comprises: fully-equipped Provençal-style kitchen/dining area; adjoining sitting room with the gorgeous original stone staircase, double-height ceilings and attractive French windows leading out to the pool area; cosy fireplace nook; double bedroom with access to a small terrace; shower room and separate WC with storage. This floor’s warmly-coloured terracotta floor tiles, exposed wooden beams, Provençal ceilings and stone arches are a visual reminder of the house’s rich history - including an ancient well serving now as a decorative indoor feature!

The first floor is composed of: principal suite comprising a spacious bedroom; generous bathroom decorated with pretty blue and white tiles; dressing room lined with fitted closets. A third bedroom with views over the Luberon, and adjacent sitting area, are accessible via stairs leading up from the main part of the sitting room.

The second floor accommodates: 43m2 standing-height attic with skylight, offering potential for a home office or fourth bedroom. 

The enclosed garden is planted with elegant cypresses, palm trees, hydrangeas, potted oleanders and other local species. An inviting stone terrace in front of the sitting room provides the perfect spot for outdoor eating or enjoying a glass of rosé at sunset. The saltwater pool is surrounded by a tidy lawn providing space for play and relaxation. At the end of the garden, stunning Moroccan folding doors reveal the summer kitchen. This space would work work equally well as an artist’s atelier or additional outdoor dining area. 

Amenities include: fibre internet; mains water and drainage and canal de Provence water for the garden; automatic watering system; electric radiators; double glazing and bespoke aluminum window frames.

This pretty property is move-in ready, offering privacy and comfort in a one-of-a-kind house. This is a great opportunity to own a true Provençal home, perfect as a primary residence, holiday retreat, or rental investment for those wanting quick access from the TGV station and airport, as well as proximity to the splendours of the Luberon.
