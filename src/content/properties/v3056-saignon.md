This exceptional property, with Saignon’s iconic landmark, Le Rocher, as its backdrop, offers you a delightful get-away with gorgeous panoramic views including Mont Ventoux and the Luberon and Lure mountains. Within walking distance of the heart of the village, with its pretty square, boulangerie and restaurants, this fully detached house is perfectly positioned for enjoying peace and quiet after exploring the Luberon’s famed perched villages, hiking the Colorado Provençal or other local trails, or spending the morning sampling the sights and tastes of Provence, a short drive away, at Apt’s sprawling Saturday market.

The ground floor is composed of: living and dining room with elegant high ceilings and exposed beams, lined with over-sized windows and doors to let in the sunlight and enjoy the sumptuous views; working fireplace with stone surround; office; fully-equipped kitchen; laundry space and mezzanine storage area. The ground floor also comprises a spacious master bedroom with French windows opening out onto a terrace with views towards Caseneuve; a second bedroom; a large bathroom with tub and shower; shower room.

At the top of the stairs is a third bedroom with a Velux window allowing sunlight to pour in; ensuite shower room with WC.

Outside you will find a treasure chest of history. In days of yore, just in front of where the house stands now, was a threshing floor where villagers brought their wheat.  It is thought that the stone fixed in the front terrace was used to grind the grain. The garden, planted with multiple varieties of shrubs, flowers and trees, is more than a third of an acre in size.  It is thoughtfully arranged to provide several spots for enjoying the views, relaxing, dining, sunbathing or keeping cool in the shade.  The 10m x 3.5m pool is heated, and fitted with an electric cover.  Old stone paths known as callades dating back to the seventeenth century lead around the house – some visible at the far side of the house, others buried.  These may have led to the windmill that stood where the house now is.  At the back of the house is a stone jas or shelter for sheep and goats.  

Amenities include: underfloor heating and cooling powered by heat pump; two portable A/C units; mains water and septic tank; Orange broadband; ring alarm; automatic watering system. A garage, parking space for three cars, wine cellar, tool shed and heating control shed complete the picture.

Fully renovated with modern conveniences, this property is unmissable!  On a clear day, you can see as far as the Alpes and always enjoy spectacular sunsets in all seasons from one of the many terraces.  It lends itself perfectly to being either a comfortable family or second home, or a rental investment.
