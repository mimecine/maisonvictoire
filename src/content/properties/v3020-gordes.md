This single-storey stone property, offering extraordinary, breathtaking views of the Luberon, is located in a charming setting just minutes from the world-renowned village of Gordes. Completely renovated in 2005, it combines modern convenience with Provençal character.

The home consists of two wings. The first wing comprises: a sumptuous 50 m2 living/dining room with an elegant stone fireplace, and doors opening out to the terrace; bespoke kitchen fitted with brand-new appliances and granite work surfaces; two bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms; utility room; guest WC.

A handsome library and study area lead down a few steps to the second wing which comprises: additional sitting room; two bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms.

For wine enthusiasts, the basement houses a smart 12m2 wine cellar, lined with wrought iron shelving to house hundreds of bottles of wine as well as the olive oil produced by the property’s own olive trees.

The property is accessed through automatic gates, leading to a spacious parking area. The impeccably maintained grounds on over two acres of land are equally impressive, with a 40 m2 double garage, an equipment room and storeroom, and a pool house. 75 olive trees and a borie (dry-stone shepherd’s hut) complete the Provençal idyll. A 33m covered terrace runs the length of the house, providing plenty of shade for enjoying the long warm days outside. The 11m x 5m salt-water pool enjoys the same superb views as the house, making it a perfect spot for relaxation, complemented by the summer kitchen. The property’s magnificent sunsets are the jewel in its crown. 

Amenities include: fully-equipped kitchen; underfloor heating; fireplace; mains water; double glazing; alarm system; basement with wine cellar.

This property enjoys an exceptional location, providing easy access to the heart of the village via a walking path leading directly from the property. Gordes was recently awarded the accolade of one of the most beautiful villages in the world.
