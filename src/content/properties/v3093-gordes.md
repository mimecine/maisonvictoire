Tucked away in a quiet and picturesque part of the Gordes countryside, this handsome stone property stands on 1.2 acres of beautifully landscaped and utterly private grounds - encompassed by a tall hedge to ensure complete intimacy. The house combines authentic Provençal character with gorgeous natural materials, high-end amenities and modern comforts and superb proportions. Whether as a comfortable family home or a luxurious Luberon retreat, the property is a rare find, remodelled and maintained to an exceptional standard. The gardens feature shaded dining terraces, a lovely swimming pool area, pétanque court, fully equipped pool house and mature olive groves.

Upon entry you are welcomed by a spacious hall with fitted cupboards, guest WC and a pretty stone staircase leading to the first floor. The ground floor enjoys an excellent flow, comprising: generous living area with dining space and adjoining sitting room arranged around a striking antique stone fireplace; sun-drenched kitchen with bespoke cabinetry, Lacanche gas range, stone fireplace and top-quality appliances (a dream for any passionate cook); secondary sitting room with light streaming in through orangery-style wrought-iron windows and doors; large larder with ample storage; utility room with access to the wine cellar, also accommodating the technical and heating systems; home gym with oversized wrought-iron doors (this space could equally serve as a ground floor bedroom or a superb office).

The first floor accommodates the bedrooms, of which the principal suite is particularly impressive - a beautifully proportioned double bedroom with high ceilings, vast walk-in dressing room, bathroom with bathtub, shower and double vanity, and a private rooftop terrace with pretty views of the Luberon mountains. The first floor further comprises: double bedroom suite with private shower room; double bedroom with mezzanine level and access to the attic (a very usable storage space); two additional double bedrooms (one currently used as an office); family bathroom with bathtub and walk-in shower; guest WC.

The grounds are landscaped and maintained to an extraordinary standard, with expansive lawns, olive groves, fruit trees and a wealth of Provençal planting (all created to ensure relative ease of maintenance). Extensive exterior lighting allows the gardens to be enjoyed well into the hot summer evenings. The living areas all open seamlessly to the gardens and terraces, with the main dining terrace draped in Lady Banks Roses - a particularly picturesque setting. Stone steps lead down to the swimming pool (10m x 5m) framed by stone surrounds, and complemented by a pool house and covered terrace with fridge, sink and barbecue area. Beyond lies the pétanque court with professional lighting. There is covered parking for two cars. The olive groves provide an annual harvest of around 125 kilos.

Amenities include: underfloor heating and cooling throughout; air-conditioning in the principal suite and two further bedrooms; thermodynamic water heater; mains water; water softener; Canal de Provence for the garden; septic tank in conformity with current regulations; sophisticated alarm and surveillance system; wood and wrought-iron double glazing; fibre optic internet. The property is fully enclosed and secured by electric gates.

This is an outstanding property, offering a unique opportunity to enjoy the best of Provençal living in a privileged setting. Conveniently located close to Gordes, Goult and Cabrières-d’Avignon, and only a short drive or cycle to Coustellet for all amenities. Understated luxury, with everything one could wish for.
