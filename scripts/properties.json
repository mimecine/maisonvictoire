    "body": "Set against the dramatic backdrop of the Luberon mountains and within walking distance of Oppède, this extraordinary estate stands as one of the most prestigious properties the Luberon has to offer. Enjoying utter privacy, the property encompasses a magnificent 18th-century bastide, five independent guest houses, a professional tennis court, and a luxurious pool house - set at the heart of over 11 acres of exquisitely landscaped grounds. Renovated throughout to an exceptional standard, the estate exudes understated luxury, with natural materials, refined design, and every possible contemporary amenity. This is the epitome of Provençal elegance - a landmark residence in the heart of the Luberon Valley.\n\nThe Bastide\nDating back to 1789, the bastide has been masterfully restored, preserving its architectural grandeur while subtly introducing modern comforts. The bastide enjoys a vast courtyard garden, centred around a traditional stone fountain and shaded by a centuries-old fig tree. Covered terraces, large dining areas, and a fully equipped summer kitchen line the edges of the courtyard, creating an enchanting setting for outdoor dining and entertaining guests.\n\nThe ground floor comprises: entrance hall with cloakroom and guest WC; kitchen with Lacornue gas range, fireplace, and breakfast area; formal dining room; elegant sitting room with ornate stone fireplace; TV room; office with direct access to the garden.\n\nThe first floor presents an impressive master suite, composed of a generous double bedroom, vast dressing room, and en-suite bathroom. Two further suites are located on this floor, each with its own en-suite bathroom. A staircase leads to the upper level, comprising a mezzanine office and dedicated accommodation for a childminder or live-in help, complete with bathroom and WC.\n\nThe lower level accommodates: utility room; technical room; wine cellar; larder; and a walk-in safe.\n\nGuest Accommodation & Annexes\nFive beautifully appointed, and air-conditioned, guest houses are located on the grounds, each offering charm, comfort, and privacy. Three feature a double bedroom and stylish shower room, while a two-bedroom gîte offers a private kitchen and sitting room - ideal for extended stays. A separate caretaker's apartment includes a kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom.\n\nThe Pool House\nThe pool house is a luxurious retreat in its own right, with a full kitchen and sun-drenched living area lined with French doors. This space also includes a sauna, cold plunge, and a spacious bathroom with a wood-burning stove - perfect for unwinding after a swim. Two double bedrooms complete the pool house. The 12m x 6m heated swimming pool is fitted with a submerged electric cover.\n\nGrounds & Amenities\nThe gardens have been meticulously landscaped, with vast lawns, a superb variety of indigenous trees, formal fountains, and wonderfully tended orchard and vegetable gardens. Meandering paths lead through the 'Jardin Bleu', planted beside the bastide, which offers a quiet elegance. A private pine woodland borders the grounds, adding to the property's superb sense of privacy. A professional tennis court with pavilion offers further recreational space, while a carport and a series of technical rooms ensure day-to-day functionality. Over 200 olive trees yield up to 450 litres of oil per year.\n\nAmenities include: central heating; reversible air conditioning throughout; fibre-optic internet; safes in every bedroom; mains water; Canal de Provence connection; private well (forage); electric entrance gate; electric fencing; comprehensive security system.\n\nThis is a property of exceptional stature - a rare blend of Provençal authenticity, architectural grace, and modern luxury, offering a privileged lifestyle in the heart of the Luberon.",

    "body": "Commanding an exceptional position overlooking the Luberon valley, this remarkable hamlet property enjoys a breathtaking natural setting, with panoramic views stretching from the eastern tip of the Luberon to the Cévennes in the west. Widely regarded as one of the most prestigious locations the region has to offer, the property combines an unrivalled sense of seclusion with timeless character and modern comfort. The estate spans over 650m2, comprising a spacious main farmhouse, an independent stone guest house, and a separate atelier/gîte outbuilding – all set at the heart of more than 6.9 acres of expertly landscaped private grounds. Entirely renovated and reimagined in 2007 with meticulous attention to detail, the interiors marry authentic character with carefully curated natural materials and bespoke contemporary fittings. Equally suited to intimate Provençal living or large-scale entertaining, this is a superb Luberon retreat of rare stature.\n\nThe Main House\n\nThe ground floor accommodates a large family kitchen fitted with a Lacanche range, a central island, and modern wrought-iron doors opening directly onto the dining terrace, revealing far-reaching views, as well as west-facing picture windows overlooking the manicured gardens. To one side, the kitchen flows through to the dining room with lovely Provençal ceilings; to the other, a traditional 'Borie' – an impressive feature room – leads into the spacious sitting room, arranged around a central suspended fireplace and framed by picture windows.\n\nA staircase leads up to the principal suite, composed of: double bedroom with private terrace draped in vines and offering views as far as the eye can see ; dressing room with fitted cupboards; bathroom with bathtub and walk-in shower; adjoining office (or additional double bedroom). Two further double bedrooms, sharing a shower room, enjoy independent access and a private west-facing terrace – ideal for guests seeking extra privacy.\n\nThe ground floor further comprises: library; cozy 'petit salon'; bright office; utility room, guest WC; impressive, temperature-controlled, wine cellar; two guest WC. The ground floor of the main house also provides access to the adjoining 'Mazet', which provides a ground-floor double bedroom with en-suite shower room and, above, a south-facing suite with private terrace granting a direct view of the Luberon mountains.\n\nGuest Accommodation & Annexes\n\nThe guest house offers complete independence, comprising: fully equipped kitchen; sitting room with fireplace; adjoining dining room; utility room. Two air-conditioned double bedrooms sharing a bathroom are located on the first floor.\n\nA second guest house, the 'atelier' serves as an inspiring creative space, with a large open-plan artist's workshop bathed in natural light, separate living space with a kitchenette, and a shower room and WC. A rooftop terrace crowns the building, delivering an impressive vantage point with panoramic views reaching as far as the Cévennes and Montpellier's Pic Saint-Loup – quite possibly one of the most remarkable views the Luberon valley has to offer.\n\nGrounds & Gardens\n\nA wooded path leads through the grounds to the house, creating a terrific sense of arrival, with the Luberon panorama as a constant backdrop. The terraced grounds spill away from the house in thoughtfully composed layers, with uninterrupted views at every turn. Vast lawns shaded by mature truffle oaks are interwoven with traditional stone-paved terraces, intimate seating spots, and generously scaled dining areas – perfectly in proportion with the property’s accommodation.\n\nPlanting is distinctly Provençal and meticulously executed - colourful hydrangeas, sculpted shrubs, agapanthus, and oleanders line the dry-stone walls and meandering pathways. Set below the house, the swimming pool is located just a few steps away from a large covered terrace with a barbecue area – an ideal setting for long, languid lunches and evening gatherings. Approximately 150 olive trees are dotted across the grounds.\n\nAmenities\n\nAmenities include: underfloor heating and cooling throughout the main house; air-conditioning in the guest house and the atelier; wood and modern wrought-iron double glazing; mains water; Canal de Provence for the garden; fibre-optic internet; electric gates; automatic watering system; garden fencing; extensive outdoor lighting.\n\nThis is a property of exceptional calibre – a rare example of Provençal authenticity, architectural charm, and modern comfort – commanding one of the finest views in the Luberon.",

Architectural plans have been drawn up for a proposed 1,200m² winery, offering exciting scope for further development of the viticultural activities on-site.\n\nThe garden encompassing the farmhouse is adorned with a greenhouse, a decorative pond and pavilion, a vegetable plot, and an expansive outdoor dining terrace - perfect for summertime dining with stunning views of the perched villages of Lacoste and Bonnieux.

Large windows frame spectacular views of the landscape, allowing light to flood the space and creating a harmonious connection between the indoors and the beauty of the Provençal countryside outside. \n\nThe ground floor of the main house is composed of a generous 35m2 living space; chic galley kitchen opening out onto a shaded terrace and the pool area; further sitting room and three bedrooms, one with ensuite, the others sharing a bathroom. The ground floor also comprises linen and laundry rooms; guest WC. The tasting room is accessible from this floor. \n\nOn the first floor: two spacious bedrooms with ensuites.\n\nThe gîte comprises: entryway leading to spacious living area with kitchen; three bedrooms; family bathroom; laundry room.\n\nIndoor/outdoor living is ensured as you step from the kitchen through to the shaded terrace and out onto the patio with views towards the Ventoux.

Uninterrupted panoramic views, complete privacy and lovely wildlife make this property stand out. Thoughtfully renovated to deliver every modern comfort, the property offers everything one could wish for in a Provençal retreat. It would serve equally well as a high‑end seasonal rental, an idyllic Luberon second home, or an inspiring setting for artistic and meditation retreats.\n\nThe property comprises a spacious main residence - the Bastide - a detached guest house set well apart for independence, and large garages that could be converted into further accommodation if desired.\n\nThe Bastide\n\nWith a commanding position at the heart of the estate, the Bastide is surrounded by private grounds. The accommodation on the ground floor comprises: large 47 m² sitting room arranged around a fireplace, with arched French doors framing the valley view and opening onto the dining terrace; light‑filled dining room with garden access; adjoining kitchen; principal suite offering generous volumes and a private bathroom (bathtub, walk‑in shower and WC). The ground floor also includes: utility room; games room; technical room; guest WC; access to the wine cellar and basement.\n\nThe first floor accommodates four further double bedrooms, each benefiting from an adjoining shower room (walk‑in shower and WC).

A gentle stream meanders along the bottom of the grounds, fed by a pond. South of the Bastide, vast terraces offer the perfect spot for outdoor dining and large‑scale entertaining. Steps take you down to the salt-water swimming pool (10 m × 5 m, with an electric cover). The land is planted with hectares of lavender, mature olives and truffle oaks.\n\nAmenities include: air‑conditioning in all bedrooms; under‑floor heating on the Bastide’s ground floor; mains water; aluminium‑framed double glazing; fibre‑optic internet; security system; electric fence around the garden.\n\nWith outstanding views of the surrounding countryside, unrivalled seclusion and a refined level of modern comfort, this is the quintessential hideaway for those seeking an unspoilt and privileged piece of the Luberon countryside.",

A WC and cloakroom complete the entrance hall.\n\nThe west wing accommodates a luxurious principal suite: beautifully proportioned bedroom, a bathroom with freestanding tub and generous walk-in shower clad in hand-cut Zellige, a private office and ample built-in storage and closets. The east side of the property offers three further bedrooms, each with its own stylish shower room finished in the same artisan tiling, double vanity units and quality fittings, guaranteeing consistent comfort throughout.\n\nThe landscaped grounds seem to merge with the Luberon mountains, with no neighbouring roofs in sight, creating an exceptional sense of privacy. The 10m × 5m swimming pool faces the view and is edged by decking, perfect for sun lounging and pool-side entertaining; an electric cover ensures safety. The 3.4-acre plot has been designed for ease of upkeep, featuring dry plantings, mature olive trees and a pocket of private oak forest. A garden studio, lined with wrought-iron windows, offers an inspiring space for creative work.\n\nAmenities include: air-conditioning and central heating; under-floor heating in the bathrooms for additional comfort; high-speed fibre-optic internet; mains water; private water source; automated irrigation; recently installed septic tank; wood-framed double glazing; electric perimeter fence and automatic entrance gates.\n\nThis impeccably re-imagined stone house occupies a sublime natural setting and delivers a rare balance of seclusion and convenience, close to vibrant villages and all amenities.

    "body": "Located in the very heart of the picturesque village of Cabrières-d’Avignon, in the Luberon, this attractive 18th-century property offers a wealth of character and traditional Provençal charm. Behind its handsome stone façade lies a property of generous scale, offering bright, well-proportioned rooms, several private terraces and a large courtyard. Formerly used for commercial purposes, it now presents an exceptional opportunity to create a spacious, comfortable and wonderfully authentic  village home. Though some reconfiguration and upgrades will be required, the potential is outstanding, and houses of this size, proportion and stature are rarely available in the village.\n\nThe ground floor is composed of: elegant drawing room with decorative mouldings and beautiful oak parquet flooring that brings warmth to this space; living space lined with wrought-iron French windows opening to the courtyard - an ideal future kitchen; professional kitchen with adjoining cold room; guest WC. The large volumes, and flexible layout ensure that the property would be well suited as a family home, a large Luberon retreat, or a lucrative seasonal rental investment.\n\nThe first floor provides three generous suites, each with its own shower room and WC - one also benefits from a lovely private roof terrace.\n\nThe second floor offers two further suites. The first comprises a large bedroom with a private sitting area, a roof terrace, and a bathroom with bathtub and shower. The second, a duplex, includes a bedroom and shower room, with an internal staircase rising to a study (or private salon) set beneath wide windows that frame incredible views of the Luberon valley.\n\nThe courtyard affords a generous outdoor living area, currently fitted with pergolas draped with vines, a summer kitchen and a fountain. The space could accommodate a swimming pool or bassin - an inviting and quiet setting.\n\nWorks and imagination would be required to needed to unleash the property’s full potential, but the combination of gorgeous original features, excellent ceiling heights and a prime position in the heart of a sought-after Luberon village ensures that this property will stand out. Cabrières-d’Avignon is an authentic village surrounded by vineyards and protected landscapes, moments from Gordes, Ménerbes, Goult, Roussillon and L’Isle-sur-la-Sorgue - one of Provence’s most desirable locations.\n\nPlease note: the photos shown are virtual staging proposals intended to help visualise the property’s potential.

Set in the heart of the Luberon’s prized Golden Triangle, this south-facing house opens out to a fabulous patio overlooking the wooded garden. Adjacent to the house is an atelier with running water and electricity.\n\nThe ground floor of the main house comprises: lovely light-filled sitting/dining area (56m2) with polished cement floor, exposed wooden beams and two handsome French windows with wrought-iron frames leading out to the patio.

Gorgeous solid wood doors, some paned to allow extra light through, are fitted throughout the house, including the bathrooms and cupboards, and are a remarkable feature.\n\nThe gîte comprises: sitting room and Provence-themed bedroom on the ground floor; mezzanine floor with shower room (with extra washing-machine) and further bedroom.\n\nThe garden is fully secluded, enclosed by walls and fragrant eleagnus hedges. It is planted with native species including green and white oaks, oleanders, olives and lavender, and remains faithful to its Provençal nature. Behind the kitchen is a herb garden, shaded outdoor dining area, plancha and woodstack. The impressive front patio, whose Virginia creeper-covered pergola provides shade for outdoor eating and relaxation, greets you as you arrive at the front door. From here, steps and pathways lead you towards the swimming pool, secured by a recently-installed electric cover. With a stone bench here, a fountain there, grassy areas and leafy hideaways, the garden lends itself superbly to family life, with plentiful places for playing and relaxing (including a wooden playhouse).\n\nAmenities include: ducted A/C throughout the main house; electric radiators in the gîte; double glazing with security glass; mains water; automatic watering system; electric gates with brand-new motor; ample parking on the property.\n\nThis spacious and beautifully presented home with its gîte, providing independent additional accommodation, would be ideal either as a family home, a Luberon retreat, or a profitable rental investment. It enjoys peace and quiet, yet is well-situated for visiting the valley’s renowned perched villages, and a convenient hour away by car from Avignon TGV and Marseille airport.",

    "body": "This lovely stone property is located a few minutes by car from the centre of the renowned village of Gordes, in a bucolic setting surrounded by trees and fields. The views towards the Luberon and the Alpilles are simply stunning, all to be enjoyed from the terrace, the lavender-scented garden, or the swimming pool. Close to the other iconic Luberon villages of Roussillon, Lacoste, Bonnieux and Ménerbes, this well-maintained property with its typical Provençal garden is a perfect base for exploring the area, and then relaxing over a glass of rosé contemplating the sunset after a day of sight-seeing.\n\nThe ground floor is composed of: open-plan sitting and dining area with fireplace, lined with French windows letting the sunlight stream in. The windows lead out to a spacious terrace, shaded with a retractible awning. The light and airy fully-equipped kitchen (including washing-machine) with sit-around island has practical direct access to the parking area. The ground floor also comprises: master bedroom with lovely views from the window and ensuite bathroom with double sink and WC; two spacious bedrooms looking out towards ‘la Colline St Jacques’ and the Alpilles mountain range; family bathroom; TV nook or play area; fourth bedroom.\n\nDownstairs to the garden level: fifth bedroom with ensuite shower room; adjoining living room with large French windows leading out to the terrace.\n\nThe garden, which covers nearly two and a half acres, and slopes gently down from the property, is home to an impressive olive grove producing over 100 litres of olive oil. Oleanders and other native plants grace the impeccably maintained grounds, and a stone pathway flanked by fragrant lavender leads you to the saltwater pool, where there is ample room for family and friends to sunbathe on loungers before taking a dip. Around the house, areas are designed for al fresco relaxing and dining in the shade (or in the sun on a bright winter day) – either on the upper or lower terrace, next to the kitchen, or under the canopy of an ancient olive tree.\n\nAmenities include: ducted reversible A/C ground floor; radiators and portable A/C unit on the garden level; all-waters septic tank meeting current regulatory standards; mains water (possibility to be hooked up to the Canal de Provence); ADSL internet; alarm; automatic watering system. Ample parking space. There is a vast crawl space at almost standing height under the house providing plentiful storage and a wine cellar. Garden shed.\n\nThis unmissable property is move-in ready. It would serve as a delightful Luberon retreat (less than an hour from Avignon TGV and Marseille airport) or as an investment property for attractive seasonal rental returns.",

    "body": "This exceptional riverside property enjoys a truly rare privilege: a private island on the crystal-clear Sorgue, complete with a natural inlet ideal for a small boat, canoe or paddleboard. Immersed in lush greenery and bordered by one of France’s most magical natural springs, this is a sanctuary of tranquillity and nature — yet less than 2 km from the heart of L’Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, just a short stroll or cycle from its vibrant cafés, Michelin-starred restaurants and world-famous antique markets.\n\nFed by the largest natural spring in France (and the fifth largest in the world), the Sorgue’s waters are naturally filtered through rock and emerge just 7 km upstream — always clear, clean and rich in wildlife. The river is known for its stable temperature of 13°C year-round, meaning it never freezes; in winter, steam rises from the surface, and even in the cooler months, swimming remains possible.\n\nThe house offers generous living spaces with abundant natural light thanks to dual-aspect windows. The ground floor includes a spacious living area with fireplace and dining space; an open, fully-equipped kitchen with Zimbabwe granite countertops; a recently built conservatory; an additional sitting room with elegant French wrought-iron doors; a utility room; two bedrooms; a bathroom; a shower room and WC.\n\nUpstairs, there are three further bedrooms, a bathroom, and a useful utility or dressing area.\n\nThe grounds are beautifully divided between the private riverside garden and the main front garden. A wooden bridge leads to the property’s very own island — a serene place to read, swim, kayak or simply watch the light dance on the water, with views toward the fields and Mont Ventoux. A charming garden studio offers private guest accommodation, an office or an artist’s retreat.\n\nTo the front of the house, safely separated and enclosed away from the river, is the pool area and children’s play space. The pool terrace enjoys sun throughout the day and is complemented by a large veranda, pool house and outdoor shower. Beyond, olive trees punctuate the garden, and a private driveway lined with vines provides ample parking.\n\nAdditional features include: underfloor heating; air conditioning; electric shutters throughout; alarm system; electric gates with intercom; private water source; heated submerged pool cover; mains water and mains drainage.\n\nA truly rare opportunity to own a riverside haven with its own private island — combining wild Provençal beauty, complete privacy and direct river access with the ease and pleasure of being moments from L’Isle-sur-la-Sorgue’s bustling centre.",

    "body": "This exceptional 18-century stone farmhouse rests serenely in the mountains above the charming Luberon village of Villars, providing a haven of peace in an unspoiled rural setting.  A family home for many years, the property has been lovingly and respectfully renovated, with a particular regard for maintaining its innate character and rich heritage, whilst creating intimate indoor spaces for the family.  The choice of natural building materials as well as the considered planting of drought-resistant plants reflect the great care taken to respect the environment.  The clear views of distant villages, and the unpolluted night sky, enhance the property’s unspoilt beauty.\n\nThe accommodation, on the ground floor, comprises: entrance hall with its original bread oven, which once fed the village’s entire working population; spacious dining kitchen with a masonry stove; utility room; large cellar; sitting room with cathedral ceiling, generous south-facing windows allowing the winter sun to pour in, and a stove to add to the warmth in winter.\n\nOn the first floor: partially laid with exotic dark fraké wood flooring; three bedrooms (the one over the living room has a glassed-in partition to allow in the light from below; family bathroom; two further bedrooms; shower room.\n\nThe house’s insulation is almost entirely made up of hemp – roof, walls, and even the floors in some rooms.  Hemp was chosen for its ecological properties and thermal performance which gives the walls a special warmth.  \n \nAnnexed to the house, with independent access, is an apartment with a generous living space, a bedroom and a shower room.  It enjoys natural light from all four sides of the building and gorgeous views to the south. With its own garden, terraces, and parking area, this apartment offers an entirely separate living space from the main house.  \n\nThe front garden is  made up of plants that don’t require watering – chosen in collaboration with the renowned ‘dry gardener’ James Basson, based in Grasse. The stone walls create a micro-climate and an ideal habitat for a diverse fauna.  White and evergreen oaks weave a dappled canopy beneath which one can enjoy an al fresco lunch or some bird-watching.  In the shade of the centennial evergreen oaks in front of the house there is always a welcome breeze coming up from the valley. As dusk settles, the garden is bathed in a golden light.\n\nThe stone walls and steps created from locally sourced stone from the valley reflect the deep history of the place.  Set on the slope of the hill the gardens are on several levels.  This adds to the magic of the environment and the restanques (terraced areas) provide many varied opportunities for outdoor living areas, such as the ‘hanging garden’, the parking areas, the vegetable garden (whose soil quality has been improved over the years to create a fertile potager), and olive grove of approximately 20 trees yielding 50 – 100 kg of olives a year.\n\nAmenities include: a wood-burning boiler; fibre optic internet; mains water; rain water collection (150m3); private well; automatic watering system in the potager; outdoor lighting on the terrace, a septic tank and electric fencing.  Additional features include ample parking; extensive storage below the property and an adjacent boiler-room.\n\nThis unique property seamlessly weaves together modern comfort with the enduring spirit of an authentic Provençal farmhouse, offering a peaceful retreat in an idyllic corner of the Luberon.  The proximity to Apt, for local supermarkets, and its renowned Saturday outdoor market, as well as Saint-Saturnin-lès-Apt and Villars (home to terrific restaurants, run by innovative young restaurateurs, such as Le Saint Hubert, Le Bar des Amis, and La Fontaine) and the Villars Golf Course (with restaurant and upcoming hotel-spa) adds to the desirability of the location.\n\nInformation on the risks to which this property is exposed is available on the Géorisques website: http://www.georisques.gouv.fr",

The setting is exceptional: the property enjoys sweeping views across the Luberon countryside, with the charm of village life just moments away. Saignon's café, bakery and restaurants are within easy reach, while the market town of Apt, with its renowned Saturday market and many amenities, is just 10 minutes by car. This is authentic Provence, where peaceful rural living meets the convenience of nearby amenities. The house sits at the heart of over two acres of beautifully landscaped grounds, commanding stunning panoramic views of rolling hills and the quintessential Provençal countryside.\n\nThe property has been thoughtfully restored, successfully balancing original character with contemporary comfort. Traditional elements - terracotta floors, exposed stone walls, and wood-burning fireplaces - have been carefully preserved, while modern amenities and tasteful decor throughout create a home of genuine quality and charm.\n\nThe main house comprises: light-filled open-plan sitting and dining room, laid with traditional terracotta tiles and arranged around a central wood-burning stove. The adjoining fully equipped kitchen features sleek cabinetry, a peninsula counter, and high-quality appliances. Both spaces open onto a vine-covered terrace framing sweeping countryside views. A few steps lead down to a stylish bathroom, a separate WC, and a spacious double bedroom with extensive built-in wardrobes. From the bedroom, a floating stone staircase leads up to a private rooftop terrace – ideal for a peaceful morning coffee or afternoon glass of rosé. \n\nThe upper level of the house includes: guest suite with its own shower room and WC, providing complete independence for visitors. Below, on the garden level, an independent gîte offers an additional bedroom, kitchenette, shower room and storage – perfect for hosting family or generating rental income.\n\nAn elegant cypress-lined driveway leads up to the property, providing an impressive sense of arrival. The gardens extend across more than two acres of gently terraced grounds, with mature lawns, established lavender plants, and beautiful trees including oak, walnut and cedar. A productive olive grove adds authentic Provençal character and yields a modest annual harvest. The heated swimming pool enjoys an elevated position with exceptional sun exposure throughout the day and panoramic views to the south and northwest. A traditional sauna is positioned behind the house, while multiple terrace areas - including the vine-covered terrace and private rooftop space - offer varied outdoor living options to suit different times of day.\n\nAmenities include: reversible air-conditioning throughout; wrought-iron double glazing with security glass; mains water; Canal de Provence for the garden; 2,500L rainwater collection tank; fibre-optic internet; electric gates and fencing; alarm system with cameras; garden sheds.

Fully equipped (including a wine fridge) it has exposed stone walls, a typical Provençal ceiling, and a wrought-iron framed window to the entrance hall, letting in more light. A door leads out to a further terrace for outdoor dining. The ground floor also comprises an office, laundry and storage room, and guest WC.\n\nThe first floor comprises: main bedroom with dressing room (plans exist to transform this into an ensuite shower room). Two further bedrooms each with fitted wardrobes; family bathroom with double sink, tub and shower; separate WC. The stairs leading to the first floor are made of Ménerbes stone, with risers set with attractive contrasting tiles.\n\nThe garden, which covers half an acre, is planted with mature specimens of native species such as olives, oaks, figs, oleanders, agapanthus and hydrangeas. It slopes gently down from the property, towards the secluded pool area with its beckoning summer kitchen equipped with a sink, fridge and grill. Whether you want to relax with friends on the shaded terrace, enjoy a meal al fresco, or sun yourself by the saltwater pool (9.5m x 4m), you will relish the privacy and the peace and quiet.\n\nAmenities include: reversible A/C units with heat pump; gas-fired central heating; electric fireplace; mains water and drainage; fibre internet; alarm and security cameras; electric gates; automatic watering system using Canal de Provence water. Ample parking and carport for 2 cars with shed. Crawl space. Summer kitchen. Pétanque court.\n\nA home to be lived in and loved through every season — ready to move into, and brimming with charm. It would serve as a delightful Luberon retreat (less than an hour from Avignon TGV and Marseille airport) or as an investment property for attractive seasonal rental returns.",

Also on this floor: principal bedroom with magnificent high ceiling, ensuite bathroom with bathtub, separate WC; bedroom with ensuite shower room. \n\nOutdoors, the walled garden with its mature trees, oleanders, vines, and other flowering plants is delightfully spacious for a village property, providing various areas for relaxing and enjoying the sunny Provençal weather, either on the deck of the 5m x 3m heated pool, its lawn, or under the shade of the outdoor kitchen. Stately mulberry trees provide a natural canopy in the heat of the day, and the eye is drawn to original features such as the abreuvoir (drinking trough) and well. Discreet outdoor lighting ensures that the garden can be enjoyed into the evening for apéritifs and dinner under the stars.\n\nAmenities include: gas-fired heating and reversible A/C in all the bedrooms; fireplace; wrought-iron window frames on the garden floor; mains drainage; mains water; fibre-optic internet; alarm; automatic watering system; parking for two cars within the property, secured by gates. \n\nThis is a rare opportunity to own a turnkey centuries-old property in the historic heart of Cabrières-d’Avignon.

Within walking distance of the heart of the village, with its pretty square, boulangerie and restaurants, this fully detached house is perfectly positioned for enjoying peace and quiet after exploring the Luberon’s famed perched villages, hiking the Colorado Provençal or other local trails, or spending the morning sampling the sights and tastes of Provence, a short drive away, at Apt’s sprawling Saturday market.\n\nThe ground floor is composed of: living and dining room with elegant high ceilings and exposed beams, lined with over-sized windows and doors to let in the sunlight and enjoy the sumptuous views; working fireplace with stone surround; office; fully-equipped kitchen; laundry space and mezzanine storage area. The ground floor also comprises a spacious master bedroom with French windows opening out onto a terrace with views towards Caseneuve; a second bedroom; a large bathroom with tub and shower; shower room.\n\nAt the top of the stairs is a third bedroom with a Velux window allowing sunlight to pour in; ensuite shower room with WC.\n\nOutside you will find a treasure chest of history. In days of yore, just in front of where the house stands now, was a threshing floor where villagers brought their wheat.  It is thought that the stone fixed in the front terrace was used to grind the grain. The garden, planted with multiple varieties of shrubs, flowers and trees, is more than a third of an acre in size.  It is thoughtfully arranged to provide several spots for enjoying the views, relaxing, dining, sunbathing or keeping cool in the shade.  The 10m x 3.5m pool is heated, and fitted with an electric cover.  Old stone paths known as callades dating back to the seventeenth century lead around the house – some visible at the far side of the house, others buried.  These may have led to the windmill that stood where the house now is.  At the back of the house is a stone jas or shelter for sheep and goats.  \n\nAmenities include: underfloor heating and cooling powered by heat pump; two portable A/C units; mains water and septic tank; Orange broadband; ring alarm; automatic watering system. A garage, parking space for three cars, wine cellar, tool shed and heating control shed complete the picture.\n\nFully renovated with modern conveniences, this property is unmissable!  On a clear day, you can see as far as the Alpes and always enjoy spectacular sunsets in all seasons from one of the many terraces.  It lends itself perfectly to being either a comfortable family or second home, or a rental investment.",

    "body": "Located on a peaceful cobbled street above the centre of the sought-after Luberon village of Bonnieux (home to boutiques, art galleries, bars, restaurants and a bustling weekly market), this thirteenth century property has been respectfully restored by its present owners to honour its long history. Safekeeping its simplicity, the renovations have been devoted to the preservation of many of the remarkable original features that make it so exceptional. The back of the house is built directly into the rock with a vaulted stone ‘troglodyte’. The exposed stone, centuries-old beams, and hardwood floors with lovely patina, tell a story of steady craftsmanship, using local and natural materials, that has stood the test of time. This is a place of comfort and peace.\n\nThe ground floor accommodates: entrance hall with deep cupboards for storage (antique wooden doors); kitchen with Lacanche range and porcelain sink; steps leading down to sun-filled living/dining room with a charming wood-burning stove gracing the stone chimney; double bedroom with ensuite shower room and WC. Adjacent to the hallway: workshop with sink, and cellar built into the stone.\n\nOn the first floor via a wooden staircase leading up from the entry way: 18m2 bedroom with fitted closets and antique clawfoot bathtub, and breathtaking views of the Cedar Forest from the window; second bedroom with a tryptic of windows overlooking the valley; family shower room with WC. Doors to the upstairs rooms are partially glazed, allowing the sunlight to stream through. The flooring on this level is all wood.\n\nRenovated over four years, the house offers a soothing palette of earth colours to enhance the sense of space and calm. Attention to detail, down to the vintage style light switch plates and taps, and antique doors, ensures complete harmony in the décor. Original features such as the exposed stone walls, Provençal ceilings, preserved tiled or flagstone floors, provide character and charm.\n\nFrench windows open out into the walled garden. The terrace, all in stone, surrounded by trees, shrubs, and potted plants, provides shaded areas to enjoy a meal al fresco looking across the valley over the rooftops, or relax and unwind. Protected by a tall stone wall, this space ensures complete privacy and intimacy.\n\nAmenities include: electric radiators; double glazing; bespoke wooden and wrought-iron window frames and doors, using traditional methods; fibre optic internet; mains water; mains drainage. The house has been thoroughly renovated with part of the roof recently replaced and insulated, and newly installed plumbing and electricity. Free public parking close-by.\n\nThe renovation reflects a deep respect for the house’s history and soul, as if time stood still. Turnkey ready, it offers a seamless blend of modern comforts with old world authenticity in an historic Luberon village. Just an hour from Avignon TGV and Marseille airport, this is a perfect pied-à-terre for exploring the Luberon or relaxing in the sanctuary of the peaceful interior, or outdoors on the shaded patio. It would make an exceptional year-round home, being in the heart of a bustling village with proximity to four Michelin starred restaurants.",

Built in 1928 at great expense by the wealthy French papermaker Andre Navarre, this striking property offers 465 sqm of living space sat on 3.7 acres of beautiful parkland.\n\nA large hall greets you at the entrance and leads into the ballroom-sized ‘Great room’ that occupies the lion’s share of the ground floor. High ceilings complimented by large arched French windows ensure an airy feel and an abundance of natural light throughout. Conceived for entertaining guests, this wonderful space comprises a sun-drenched formal dining area, breakfast table and casual seating arranged around the fireplace.\n\nAdditionally, on the ground floor: large kitchen with French windows out to south facing terrace and additional dining table; cloakroom; utility room; large larder. A “caretaker’s gite” on the ground floor provides a self-contained living space for family and guests with an independent entrance. This is composed of a kitchen / diner, bathroom and double bedroom.\n\nThe first floor is composed of three suites. The master suite comprises a 36 sqm bedroom with marble fireplace and parquet floors, an airy study with its own south-west facing balcony, bathroom, and dressing room. The second suite features a 22 sqm bedroom adorned with two lovely marble fireplaces and a shower room en suite. Both these suites have large French windows leading out onto a romantic balcony overlooking the Monts de Vaucluse. A further double bedroom with shower room en suite is on this floor.\n\nThe second floor is comprised of: two generous double bedrooms; shower room; large artist’s studio that could be converted into a further bedroom; attic storage room.\nThere is a full basement underneath the property housing the oil-fired central heating system, UV water purifier for the spring water, and water softener. There is also a large cold room and four more rooms, used for storage and as workshops. The property has water from the canal de Provence for the garden, and a private spring providing crystal clear drinking water that is also used to fill the swimming pool. \n\nA plane tree lined driveway leads up through the parkland to the property. A modern 12 m x 4 m swimming pool sits comfortably below the property and is surrounded by a wonderful lawn, fruit tree orchard and sculptural pines. Large terraces, verandas and balconies adorn every façade of the house, providing copious outdoor sitting and dining areas that can be enjoyed from sunrise to sunset.\n\nAlthough some refreshing is required to restore this building to its former glory, the layout and proportions of this unique property will guarantee a fantastic result. Ideally situated just 5 minutes from L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, Saumane Golf course and the Petit Palais farmers’ market.",

The first floor is composed of four bedrooms, each with an en-suite bathroom or shower room. \n\nThe second floor accommodates four bedrooms and three shower rooms. \n\nThe lower, garden-level, is composed of: garage; wine cellar; laundry room; boiler room with oil-fired central heating; bike room.\n\nThe 17 acres of landscaped grounds offer vast terraces, gorgeous water features fed by a natural spring, and an impressive 20m x 7m swimming pool (with a submerged cover and adjoining pool house). The whole property is beautifully wooded and boasts a particularly spectacular driveway lined with cypress trees.\n\nThe property is located just a few minutes from the bustling market town of Apt, with its shops and famous Provencal market, yet enjoys lovely views over the surrounding hills and gardens and retains all the charm of its privacy.",

Needless to say, the property is ideally laid out to accommodate friends and family throughout the year. The house also has a recently installed swimming pool with stone walls, lavender and, olive trees surrounding it - a subtle reminder that you are in the heart of the Luberon. There is equally ample outdoor parking and a pétanque court to the rear of the house. \n\nThe renovation has been meticulously carried out to completion. Smooth limestone tiles cover the kitchen and “Salle des Fêtes”. The renovation equally included structural work to bring the property into the 21st century, with modern double-glazing, roof insulation, sealing and treatment of the beams, a brand new oil-fired central heating system, and revised plumbing and electrics. Hidden in-built storage units located throughout keep the house feeling clean and spacious. \n\nAn authentic, but modernised character property in a peaceful and privileged Luberon location.\n\nNeighboring constructible land can be purchased with the property – see ref V2448.",

Two small terraces to the rear of the house can be accessed from the kitchen and the workshop.\n\nThe first floor is composed of: 50m² master bedroom with adjoining shower room and south-facing private roof terrace; south-facing double bedroom; single bedroom; guest bathroom with loo; study.\n\nThe second floor accommodates a modern, self-contained suite with superb Luberon views. On one side of this space lies a sitting room, fitted with a wood-burning stove and a contemporary kitchen area. A stylish shower room creates a boundary between the sitting room and the double bedroom. Authentic terracotta floor tiles, exposed beams and high ceilings complement the contemporary décor and layout.\n\nThe property and the garden are concealed behind stone walls and a large gated archway. Once inside, you are greeted by a spacious covered terrace, with the garden and swimming pool just beyond. A 30m² double garage offers secure parking with ample room to spare for storage of any garden furniture and equipment. A small workshop, pool house, and additional covered terrace complete the garden. The 6m x 4m swimming pool is equipped with a ‘swim against the current function’, however it should be noted that it requires re-tiling or fitting with a liner. \n\nWith a great indoor/outdoor balance, simple layout, and an abundance of character throughout, this property would make a fantastic family home or and easy-to-maintain getaway in the heart of the Luberon valley.",

    "body": "Located on the edge of the perched Luberon village of Roussillon, this attractive property comprises a single-storey house and an adjacent stone guest house. The property offers excellent privacy, generous interior volumes, and a wealth of authentic character. Uninterrupted views of the Luberon valley can be enjoyed throughout. The layout is ideal for accommodating family and friends, with privacy for all. The independent guest house ('gîte') also offers strong rental potential, without the need for owners to share living space. The entire property has been renovated to a high standard, with quality natural materials, bespoke fittings, and modern comforts throughout.\n\nFrench doors open from the main terrace into the main living space, ensuring excellent natural light and a seamless transition from indoors and outdoors - ideal for entertaining or simply enjoying the panoramic views and colourful mediterranean sunsets.\n\nThe main house features a spacious open-plan layout that includes: large dining area; sitting room with a handsome reclaimed stone fireplace and bespoke fitted library; contemporary kitchen; guest WC. French doors throughout provide access to the south-facing dining terrace, while there is a second, covered, breakfast terrace to the rear. Exposed beams, travertine floor tiles, and neutral tones ensure bright airy living spaces.\n\nThe master bedroom lies just beyond the living area, offering floor-to-ceiling oak wardrobes, two oversized French doors opening onto the terrace, and an ensuite shower room with WC. This suite enjoys a particularly lovely view of Roussillon’s iconic ochre cliffs and the Luberon valley.\n\nThe adjacent gîte benefits from its own entrance, both from the main terrace and the parking area. It is arranged as a fully independent guest house, with a kitchen, sitting room (or third bedroom), and shower room with WC on the main level, and two additional bedrooms with ensuite shower rooms on the upper levels. The configuration comfortably accommodates four to six guests.\n\nThe large main terrace overlooks the valley below. A centenary olive tree and wrought-iron pergolas add structure to the space and shade during the long summer months. Steps from the breakfast terrace lead to a small upper terrace with particularly impressive views of the rooftops and surrounding countryside. The property also includes two remarkable wine cellars: one set against the ochre rockface, and another, older cellar carved directly into the stone beneath the house.\n\nThe property boasts a large garage (17 m²), additional private parking, and automatic gates.\n\nAmenities include: wood-framed double glazing; mains water; mains drainage; reversible air conditioning; alarm system.\n\nThis is a cleverly re-imagined village house in one of the Luberon’s most iconic villages. With superb views, generous living spaces, and excellent outdoor areas, it is ideally located just a short stroll from Roussillon’s restaurants, cafés, shops and boulangerie.",

It is suitable as a family home, a pied-à-terre in the Luberon, or an investment to let as a seasonal rental.  \n\nThe ground floor is composed of a fully-equipped bespoke Fabre kitchen (with plumbing for a dishwasher) and a sitting/dining room.  Adjacent to the dining area is a further south-facing space with a newly-installed pellet-burning stove gracing the chimney hearth, which is decorated with gorgeous Italian tiles.  The south-facing windows allow natural light to flood this space and with the kitchen windows also open, there is a pleasant cross-breeze through the house in warmer months.  On this floor is a bathroom with loo, bathtub, and washer and dryer.\n\nOn the first floor are the master bedroom, and guest bedroom with a lovely view towards the Luberon mountains.  The bathroom on this floor has a loo and shower.  Both bedrooms have reversible air conditioning.\n\nThe top floor is accessed via the master bedroom, and grants impressive Luberon views.  With its own air-conditioning unit, it is currently used as a home gym and bar, kitted out with a sink and wine fridge.  This space could also serve as a third bedroom or office.\n\nThis lovely village property comes with its own garage and vaulted cellar, accessible from the street below.  There is already access to water and electricity here.\n\nAn excellent opportunity to invest in a tastefully-renovated village house nestled at the foot of the village’s iconic medieval château and chapel, yet just a few steps from all the cafés, shops and restaurants!",
